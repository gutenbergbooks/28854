<h2>THE LEADER OF THE<br />
LOWER SCHOOL</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>Gipsy Arrives</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">One</span> dank, wet, clammy afternoon at the beginning of
October half a dozen of the boarders at Briarcroft
Hall stood at the Juniors' sitting-room window, watching
the umbrellas of the day girls disappear through
the side gate. It had been drizzling since dinner-time,
and the prospect outside was not a remarkably
exhilarating one. The yellow leaves of the oak tree
dripped slow tears on to the flagged walk, as if weeping
beforehand for their own speedy demise; the little
classical statue on the fountain looked a decidedly
watery goddess, the sodden flowers had trailed their
heads in the soil, and a small rivulet was running
down the steps of the summer house. As the last
two umbrellas, after a brief and exciting struggle
for precedence, passed through the portal and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
gate was shut with a slam, Lennie Chapman turned
to her companions and heaved a tragic sigh.</div>

<p>"Isn't it withering?" she remarked. "And just on
the very afternoon when we'd made up our minds to
decide the tennis championship, and secured all the
courts for the Lower School. I do call it the most
wretched luck! I'm a blighted blossom!"</p>

<p>"We'll never persuade the Seniors to give us all the
courts again!" wailed Fiona Campbell. "They said so
emphatically that it was only to be for this once."</p>

<p>"I believe they knew it was going to be wet!"
growled Dilys Fenton.</p>

<p>"You don't think if it cleared a little we might
manage just a set before tea?" suggested Norah Bell
half hopefully.</p>

<p>"My good girl, please to look at the lawn! Do
you think anyone in her senses would try to play on
a swamp like that?"</p>

<p>"It's getting too late in the year for tennis," yawned
Hetty Hancock. "Don't believe we shall get another
game at all. We'd better resign ourselves."</p>

<p>"Resign ourselves to what?" asked Daisy Scatcherd.</p>

<p>"Why, to leaving the championship till next
summer, and to not going out to-day, and to sitting
stuffing here and moaning our bad luck, and feeling
as cross as a bear with a toothache&mdash;at least, that's
how I feel: I don't know what the rest of you do!"</p>

<p>"I should like to have gone home with the day
girls," sighed Dilys Fenton.</p>

<p>"No, you wouldn't!" snapped Norah Bell. "You
know it's jollier to be a boarder; we do have some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
jolly times, even if it does rain. You can't expect it
always to keep fine, and as for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Norah, don't preach! We must have our
growls&mdash;it lets off steam. I think it's the wretchedest,
miserablest, detestablest, most altogether sickening
afternoon that ever was&mdash;there!"</p>

<p>"If only something would happen, just to cheer us
up a little!" said Lennie Chapman, opening the window
rather wider and putting her head out into the
rain.</p>

<p>"What do you want to happen?"</p>

<p>"Why, something exciting, of course&mdash;something
interesting and jolly, and out of the common, to
wake us up and make things more lively."</p>

<p>"You'll fall out of the window if you lean over like
that, and that would be lively, in all conscience, if
you were picked up in fragments. Come in; you're
getting your hair wet."</p>

<p>"Let me alone! I shan't! I say, what's that?
There's a cab turning in at the gate; it's coming up
the drive!"</p>

<p>Five extra heads immediately poked themselves
out of the window regardless of the rain, for the
Juniors' sitting-room commanded an excellent view
both of the carriage drive and of the front steps.</p>

<p>"It is a cab!" murmured Dilys excitedly.</p>

<p>It certainly was a cab, just an ordinary station
four-wheeler, with a box on the top of it, bearing the
initials G. L. painted in large white letters. As the
vehicle came nearer they could see a girl's face inside,
and&mdash;yes, she apparently caught sight of the row of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
heads peering out of the window, for she smiled and
turned to somebody else who sat beside her. There
was a grinding of wheels on the gravel, the cab drew
up at the steps, the door opened, and out hopped a
dark-haired damsel in a long blue coat. She gave
one hurried glance at the window, smiled again and
waved her hand, then vanished inside the porch,
where she was instantly followed by her companion,
a middle-aged gentleman, who carried a bag. The
cabman began to take down the box, and the sound
of the front door bell could be heard plainly&mdash;a loud
and vigorous peal, forsooth&mdash;enough almost to break
the wire! The six Juniors subsided into their sitting-room.
Here, at least, was something happening.</p>

<p>"Who is she?"</p>

<p>"Where's she come from?"</p>

<p>"Is she a new girl?"</p>

<p>"Haven't heard of anybody new coming. Have
you?"</p>

<p>"She looks jolly."</p>

<p>"I hope she's going to stay."</p>

<p>"I say, let's go downstairs and ask if anyone knows
anything about her," said Hetty Hancock, suiting her
action to her words, and hurrying out of the room
with her five schoolmates following close at her heels.
But nobody knew; not even the Seniors could give
the least information. Indeed, the six who had seen
the newcomer from the window had the advantage,
for none of the others had witnessed the arrival. The
girls were consumed with curiosity. A scout, who
ventured ten steps into the forbidden territory of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
front hall, came back and reported that talking could
be heard in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"A big, deep voice, like a man's, and Poppie's saying
'Yes'. I daren't stop more than a second; but somebody's
there, you may be sure of that. And the box
is standing in the vestibule too."</p>

<p>"I believe she's come to stay!" said Dilys.</p>

<p>"The cab's waiting at the door still, though,"
objected Norah Bell. "She may be going back in it."</p>

<p>At tea-time Miss Poppleton's accustomed place was
empty, and speculation ran high among her pupils.
All kinds of wild rumours circulated round the table,
but there was no means of verifying any of them, and
the girls were obliged to go to preparation with their
curiosity still unsatisfied. At seven o'clock, however,
when the Juniors had finished their work and trooped
back to their own sitting-room, they found the mystery
solved. In front of the fire, warming her hands between
the bars of the high fender, and looking as
comfortably at home as if she owned the place, stood
the stranger who had skipped so quickly out of the
cab that afternoon. She was a girl who, wherever
she was seen, would have attracted notice&mdash;slim and
erect and trim in figure, and a decided brunette, a
real "nut-brown maid", with a pale olive complexion,
the brightest of soft, dark, southern eyes, and a quantity
of fluffy, silky, dusky curls, tied&mdash;American
fashion&mdash;with two big bows of very wide scarlet
ribbon, one on the top of her head and one at the
nape of her neck. She smiled as the others entered,
showing an even little set of white teeth, and four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
roguish dimples made their appearance at the corners
of her mouth. She seemed to have assumed proprietorship
of the room so entirely that the Juniors stopped
short in amazement, too dumbfounded for the moment
to do anything but stare. The stranger stepped forward
with almost an air of welcome and, dropping a
mock curtsy, announced herself.</p>

<p>"Glad to make your acquaintance!" she began.
"Miss Poppleton said she'd introduce me to the school,
but I guessed I'd rather introduce myself&mdash;thought
I'd do the thing better than she would, somehow. I
don't like stiff introductions&mdash;I'm not at all a starchy
sort of person, as I dare say you can see for yourselves;
and I prefer to make friends after my own fashion.
My name's Gipsy Latimer, and I'm American and
British and Colonial and Spanish all mixed up, and
I've travelled half round the world, and been in seven
different schools, and I was fourteen last birthday,
and I arrived here this afternoon, and I'm going to
stop on a while, and I just adore cricket, and I detest
arithmetic in any shape, and I'm always ready for
any fun that's on the go. There! I've told you all
about myself," and she curtsied again.</p>

<p>The girls laughed. There was something decidedly
attractive and breezy about the newcomer. Her dark
eyes danced and twinkled as she spoke, and there
was an unconventional jollity in the very high-pitched
tone of her voice, and an infectious merriment in her
dimples.</p>

<p>"What did you say your name was?" asked Hetty
Hancock, by way of making the first advances.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's right&mdash;fire off your questions! I've been at
seven schools before this, and everybody starts with
the same catechism. I'm ready to answer anything
within reason, but perhaps I'd best take a seat while
you're at it. No, thanks! I prefer the table&mdash;always
like the highest place, you see! I've sat on the mantel-piece
before now. Yes, I said my name was Gipsy&mdash;G&mdash;I&mdash;P&mdash;S&mdash;Y."</p>

<p>"But it's not your real name, surely?"</p>

<p>"You weren't christened that?"</p>

<p>"Only wish I had been! No, my godfather and
godmothers didn't know their business, and they
went and gave me the most outlandish, sentimental,
ridiculous, inappropriate name you could imagine.
You might try a dozen guesses, and you'd never hit
on it. Don't you want to guess? Well, I'll tell you,
then&mdash;it's Azalea."</p>

<p>"Azalea&mdash;why, I think that's rather pretty," ventured
Lennie Chapman.</p>

<p>"Pretty enough in itself, perhaps, but it doesn't
suit me. Do I look like an 'Azalea' with my dark
hair and eyes? They should have had more sense
when they christened me. Why, an Azalea ought to
be a little, pretty, silly thing, with blue eyes and pink
cheeks and golden hair&mdash;all beauty, you know, and
no brains, like this girl! What's your name? You're
more an Azalea than I am."</p>

<p>"I'm Barbara Kendrick!" gasped that flaxen-headed
member of the Upper Third, not quite knowing
whether to be flattered or offended.</p>

<p>"There you are&mdash;not a bit like a Barbara! Nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
in the least barbarous about you. I think there ought
to be a law against naming a girl till she's old enough
to choose for herself. Well, as I told you, I was
christened Azalea, but everybody saw from the first
it didn't fit. 'She's a regular little gipsy!' Dad said;
so they called me Gipsy, and Gipsy I mean to be. I
made Dad tell Miss Poppleton so, and enter me Gipsy
on the school books. I wasn't going to start in a new
place as Azalea."</p>

<p>"So you've been to school before?" said Dilys Fenton.</p>

<p>"Rather! I told you I've been to seven schools&mdash;three
in America, two in New Zealand, one in Australia,
and one in South Africa. This is the first
English school I've tried."</p>

<p>"Seven&mdash;and you're only fourteen! Why, you
must have been to a fresh one every year!"</p>

<p>Gipsy nodded.</p>

<p>"You're just about right there. Never stayed more
than two terms at any of them. No&mdash;they didn't
expel me! I tell you, I'm an absolute miracle of good
behaviour when I like. It was simply because Dad
and I were always moving on, and whenever he went
to a fresh place I had to go to a fresh school. You
don't think I'd let him leave me in America when he
was going to Australia, do you?"</p>

<p>"Haven't you got a mother?" asked Barbara Kendrick.</p>

<p>"Shut up, you stupid!" murmured Dilys Fenton,
giving Barbara a nudge.</p>

<p>Gipsy rolled her handkerchief into a tight ball, and
unrolled it again before she replied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've nobody in the world but Dad," she answered,
and there was just a suspicion of huskiness in her
voice. "He's never gone far away from me before,
but he's starting to-morrow for South Africa, and
I'm to stop here till he comes back. He says it won't
seem long. I hope I'm going to like it. I've only
been three days in England, and you're the first English
girls I've spoken to. Dad said England ought to
feel like home, but it's a queer kind of home when
one's all alone. Tell me what this school is like. Is
Miss Poppleton nice? She gushed over me before Dad
in the drawing-room, but she looks as if she could
be a Tartar, all the same. I've had a little experience
with schoolmistresses. I can generally take
their measure in five minutes. She's got a sister,
hasn't she&mdash;a Miss Edith, who showed me my bedroom?
I expect I shall like her. Have I hit the
mark?"</p>

<p>The girls looked at one another and laughed.</p>

<p>"Just about," said Fiona Campbell. "Poppie's temper
varies like the barometer. One day she's at 'set fair',
and calls everybody 'dear', or 'my child'; and the next
she's at 'stormy', and woe betide you if you so much
as drop your serviette at dinner, or happen to sneeze
in the elocution class! Miss Edie's ripping! She
doesn't teach much&mdash;only one or two classes. She
does the housekeeping, and sees we keep our clothes
tidy, and change our wet stockings, and all that sort
of thing."</p>

<p>"And how many are there of you? Remember, I've
been dumped down here at a day's notice, and I know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
absolutely nothing at all about the school yet. Is it a
big one?"</p>

<p>"Twenty boarders and seventy-two day girls&mdash;that's
ninety-two, and you'll make the ninety-third. There
are eight Senior boarders, and they've got a sitting-room
of their own, with a carpet on the floor. We,
the common herd, are only provided with linoleum, as
you see."</p>

<p>"Eight from twenty leaves twelve! You're not all
here."</p>

<p>"No; two of us are practising, and the kids have
half an hour with Miss Edith before they go to bed."</p>

<p>"Shouldn't mind half an hour with Miss Edith myself.
By the by, are you keen on Fudge here?"</p>

<p>The girls stared.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," returned Hetty
Hancock rather stiffly. "What is Fudge?"</p>

<p>Gipsy threw out her arms in mock horror.</p>

<p>"Shades of Yankee Doodle!" she exclaimed. "These
benighted Britishers have actually never heard of the
magic name Fudge! Why, in the States it's a word
to conjure with! I've known some girls who absolutely
lived for it."</p>

<p>"You haven't told us what it is yet. Is it a game?"</p>

<p>Gipsy laughed till she nearly collapsed off the table.</p>

<p>"A game? No; Fudge is candy&mdash;the most delicious
adorable stuff you ever tasted. Get me a pan, and
some sugar, and some milk, and some butter, and I'll
make some for you this instant. How you'll bless
me!"</p>

<p>"Don't I wish you could!" sighed Norah Bell. "But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
we're not allowed to make toffee except on the 5th of
November. They let us have a pan then, and we boil
it over this fire."</p>

<p>"We'll have a pan of our own here," said Gipsy
cheerily. "I'll go out and buy one to-morrow. I
can't exist without Fudge."</p>

<p>"But we aren't allowed to go out and buy things,"
exclaimed the girls in chorus.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me we mayn't go on the least
scrap of an errand if we ask leave?"</p>

<p>"Not if you ask ever so!"</p>

<p>"Why, that's dreadful! I can't be boxed up like
that. I'd as soon be in prison. I'm afraid you'll find
me walking out on my own sometimes."</p>

<p>"You'll get into an uncommonly big scrape if you
do!"</p>

<p>"Dad warned me I'd have to be very prim and
proper in England," said Gipsy, looking serious, "but
I didn't know things were as bad as that. I'll begin
to wish I hadn't come here. Oh dear! we were going
right through to Chicago if we hadn't been shipwrecked,
and I love America."</p>

<p>"Shipwrecked!" shrieked the girls. "Do you mean
to tell us you've been in a real wreck?"</p>

<p>"Only just come from it," replied Gipsy calmly.
"A very wet, cold, unpleasant affair it was, too!
Especially in only one's nightdress! Every rag of
clothing I possessed went to the bottom. Dad had
to rig me out again at Liverpool. That's why I've
come to this school in such a hurry. Dad lost his
papers, and had to go back to South Africa, and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
wouldn't take me with him this time. So you see
I've been sprung upon you suddenly&mdash;an unexpected
blessing, you might call me."</p>

<p>"Oh, do tell us about the wreck!" implored Hetty
Hancock. "I've never in all my life met anybody
who'd really and truly been shipwrecked."</p>

<p>"All right! Come and squat by the fire. I'm tired
of the table, and prefer the floor for a change. Please
don't expect anything extra blood-curdling, for you
won't get it, unless you'd like me to romance a little.
Where do you want me to begin? All my adventures
in all the places I've lived at? That's rather a big
order. You'll have to be contented with a piece. Here
goes!"</p>

<p>But as Gipsy's descriptions, though graphic, were
not of a remarkably lucid character, it will perhaps be
well to omit her version of the story, and, for a better
understanding of her independent, whimsical little
self, give a brief account of her previous career in a
separate chapter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>The "Queen of the Waves"</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Into</span> the fourteen years of her life Gipsy had certainly
managed to compress a greater variety of experiences
than falls to the share of most girls of her age. She
had been a traveller from her earliest babyhood, and
was familiar with three continents. Her father was a
mining engineer, and in the course of his profession was
obliged to visit many out-of-the-way spots in various
corners of the globe. As Gipsy was all he had left to
remind him of her dead mother, he never could bear
to be parted from her for long, and he would generally
contrive to put her to school at some place within
tolerably easy reach of the vicinity of his mining
operations. In the holidays he would sometimes take
her up to camp, and Gipsy had spent long delightful
weeks in the hills, or the bush, sleeping under canvas,
or in a log cabin or a covered wagon, and living the
life of the birds and the rabbits as regards untrammelled
freedom.</div>

<p>She had grown up a thorough little Colonial, self-dependent
and resourceful, able to catch her own
horse and saddle it, to ride barebacked on occasion,
and to be prepared for the hundred and one accidents<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and emergencies of bush life. She had taken a hand
at camp cookery, helped to head cattle, understood
the making of "billy" tea, and could find her own
way where a town-bred girl would have been hopelessly
lost. The roving life had fostered her naturally
enterprising disposition; she loved change and variety
and adventure, and in fact was as thorough-hearted a
young gipsy as any black-eyed Romany who sells
brooms in the wake of a caravan. At her various
schools she had of course learnt to submit to some
kind of discipline, but her classmates were Colonials,
accustomed to far more freedom, than is accorded to
English girls, and the rules were not nearly so strict
as in similar establishments at home.</p>

<p>After a year spent in South Africa, Mr. Latimer
was prepared to return to America, and, wishing to
do some business in London <i>en route</i>, had booked
passages for himself and Gipsy on the <i>Queen of the
Waves</i>, a steamer bound from Durban to Southampton.
Gipsy was an excellent sailor, and thoroughly enjoyed
life at sea. She would cajole the captain to allow her
to walk upon the bridge, or peep inside the wheelhouse;
or persuade the second mate to take her to inspect the
engines, or teach her flag-signalling on the upper deck:
and wheedled marvellous and impossible stories of
sharks and storms from the steward. The voyage
had passed quickly, and until the headlands of the
north coast of Spain were sighted had been quite uneventful.</p>

<p>"Only a few days more, and we shall be in port,"
said Mr. Latimer, looking through his pocket telescope<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
at the outline of Cape Finisterre. "I think we may
congratulate ourselves on the splendid weather we've
had the whole time."</p>

<p>"We mustn't boast too soon," returned Captain Smith.
"There are some ugly clouds gathering, and I shouldn't
be surprised if we had a rough night of it in the Bay.
What would you say, Gipsy, if we had the fiddles on
the table at dinner?"</p>

<p>"Those queer racks to keep the plates from slipping
about? Oh, I'd love to see them on! I've never been
in a big storm. The wind may just blow, and blow,
and blow to-night. The old sailor who sits on the top
of the North Pole can untie all the four knots in his
handkerchief if he likes."</p>

<p>"Don't wish for too much. One knot will be quite
sufficient for us if we're to get across the Bay in comfort.
You'll tell a different tale by to-morrow morning,
I expect."</p>

<p>As the captain had prophesied, the dark clouds
gathered quickly, and brought both a squall and a
shower. The vessel was entering the Bay of Biscay,
and that famous stretch of water was already beginning
to justify its bad reputation. Gipsy had the
satisfaction, not only of seeing the racks used at
dinner, but of witnessing half the contents of her
plate whirled across the table by a sudden lurch of
the ship. The rolling was so violent that she could
not cross the cabin without holding tightly to solid
objects of furniture.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we're going to have a terrible tossing,"
said Mr. Latimer, as he bade Gipsy good night. "Mind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
you don't get pitched out of your bunk. We're having
bad weather with a vengeance now."</p>

<p>"The old sailor on the North Pole has untied all
four knots," said Gipsy to herself, as she lay awake
listening to the blowing of the gale. It was indeed
a fearful storm. The vessel was tossed about like a
cork: one moment her bows would be plumped deep
in the water, and her stern lifted in mid-air, with the
whirling screw making a deafening noise overhead;
then all would be reversed, and the timbers seemed to
shiver with the effort the ship made to right herself.</p>

<p>Gipsy found it impossible to sleep when her heels
were continually being raised higher than her head,
and sometimes a sudden roll would threaten to fling
her even over the high wooden side of her berth.
Everything in the cabin had fallen to the floor, and
her boots, clothes, hairbrush, books, and indeed all her
possessions were chasing one another backwards and
forwards with each lurch of the vessel. The noise was
terrific: the howling of the wind and the roaring of the
waves were augmented by the creaking of timbers, the
clanking of chains, and an occasional crashing sound
that appeared to come from below, where the cargo
had broken loose, and was being knocked about in the
hold.</p>

<p>For an instant there seemed to be a lull; then, as
if the storm had been waiting to gather fresh fury,
a tremendous sea swept down upon the ship, dashing
across the decks with a roar like thunder. Gipsy hid
her face in her pillow. It would pass, she supposed,
as the other waves had passed, and they would steam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
on as before. Then all at once she sat up in her berth.
The great throb, like a pulsing heart to the vessel, that
had never ceased day or night since they left Durban
was suddenly still. The engines had stopped working.
A moment afterwards her father burst into the cabin.</p>

<p>"Gipsy, child!" he exclaimed. "We must go on
deck! Here, fling this coat round you! No, no! You
can't wait to dress! We've sprung a bad leak, and the
captain says we must take to the boats. Hold tight
to my arm, and be a brave girl!"</p>

<p>It was with the utmost difficulty that the pair made
their way up the lurching stairs on to the deck. Here
the wind was furious, and would have blown them
overboard had they not clung to the railings for support.
In the fitful gleams of moonlight Gipsy could
see towering waves rise like great mountains, and fall
against the ship. The sailors were already lowering
the boats, and she could hear the sound of the captain's
speaking-trumpet as he shouted his orders above the
noise of the storm. Were they indeed to trust themselves
to the mercy of that terrible sea? Gipsy
watched with alarm as the first frail-looking boat was
successfully launched on the seething water.</p>

<p>"Have I time to fetch my papers?" asked Mr.
Latimer, as the captain came in their direction.</p>

<p>"No; only to save yourself and your child," was the
hasty reply. "Come at once; the vessel is filling fast,
and may settle even before we can get off her."</p>

<p>When Gipsy afterwards recalled the various events
of that night, she decided that the most dreadful
moment of all was when, with a lifebelt fastened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
round her waist, she was lowered over the ship's side.
Both the vessel and the lifeboat were so pitched about
by the enormous waves that it was a perilous passage;
for a few seconds she swung in mid-air, with only
blinding foam and spray around her. Then there was
a shout, she was grasped by strong hands from below,
and drawn down into a place of comparative security.
In another minute her father had followed her, and
was seated by her side. The captain waited till all
the boats were launched and he had seen the last of his
crew off in safety, and he had scarcely left the deck
himself and taken his place in the lifeboat before the
doomed vessel heeled over, and with no further sign
or warning disappeared into the depths.</p>

<p>All night long, through the cold and darkness, the
little party was tossed upon the surface of the swirling
waters; but towards dawn the storm abated, and
when day broke, the sea, though still running fast,
was sufficiently calm to enable the sailors to make
some use of their oars. They put up a signal of distress,
and waited anxiously, hoping that some passing
vessel might notice them, and stop to pick them up.
Hour after hour went by. Cold, hungry, and drenched
to the skin, Gipsy tried to be brave, and to bear
patiently what she knew must be endured equally by
all. The sun rose high, and shone down warmly upon
them, but there was still no sign of either land or a
ship. It was long past noon when one of the crew,
with a jubilant shout, pointed eagerly to a tiny black
streak of smoke on the horizon, which they knew must
issue from the funnel of some distant steamer. With<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
frantic energy they waved jackets and handkerchiefs,
to try to attract the attention of those on board.
Would they be seen, or would the ship pursue her
course without noticing the small speck far away on
the water? There was a minute of horrible uncertainty,
then: "They've sighted us!" yelled the captain.
"They're turning her about and putting her back!"</p>

<p>"Thank God we're saved!" exclaimed Mr. Latimer.</p>

<p>The rest seemed like a dream to Gipsy. She could
remember afterwards that she was helped by two
sailors up the companion way of a tall liner, and that
she saw a long row of excited passengers staring at
her over the railings; then all became a blur, and when
she came to herself she was lying on a couch in a
strange cabin, with her father and a doctor bending
over her.</p>

<p>"She only fainted from exhaustion," she could hear
the doctor saying. "We'll soon have her all right again.
Ah, here comes the beef tea! A few hours of sound
sleep will make all the difference. When she wakes,
you'll find she's almost herself again."</p>

<p>Five days later found Gipsy seated at breakfast
with her father in the coffee-room of a Liverpool hotel,
none the worse for her adventures. The liner that
had picked up all the survivors of the ill-fated <i>Queen
of the Waves</i> had been on her way to Liverpool, and
Mr. Latimer decided to make a brief stay there, to
secure new clothes for himself and Gipsy, and to gain
time to make fresh plans for the future. Though he
had fortunately been able to bring a certain sum of
money away with him, all their other possessions had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
gone down with the wrecked vessel, and it was this
loss which he and Gipsy were discussing as they drank
their morning tea.</p>

<p>"It was distinctly awkward to be left with nothing
in the world but a nightdress that I could call my
own!" laughed Gipsy. "Wasn't it funny on the
<i>Alexia</i>? People were ever so kind in lending me
things, but they didn't fit. Mrs. Hales' skirt swept
the deck, and Mrs. Campbell's jacket was miles too
big for me. I must have looked an elegant object
when we reached the landing stage! I don't wonder
you bundled me into a cab in a hurry, and drove
straight off to an hotel. Yes, it's decidedly unpleasant
to lose one's clothes."</p>

<p>"If it were only clothes we'd lost, Gipsy, I shouldn't
mind, but it's a far more serious affair than that. All
my valuable papers are gone, child! You don't realize
yet what that means. It makes such an enormous
difference to my affairs that for the next few years
it may entirely alter the course of my life."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Dad?" asked Gipsy quickly,
for her father's tone was grave.</p>

<p>"What I say. The loss of those papers will necessitate
a complete change of all my plans. Instead of
our going on to America, I shall be obliged to return
to South Africa at once."</p>

<p>"More voyaging! All right, Dad; I'm game for
another wreck, if you are! It'll seem rather funny
to go back to where we've just come from, won't it?"</p>

<p>Mr. Latimer was silent for a moment or two.</p>

<p>"Gipsy!" he said at last, "I've got to break the news<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
to you somehow. I've decided not to take you back
with me to the Cape. I want to go up-country, into
some rather wild places, places where you couldn't
possibly come to camp. You'd be far best at school
here in England."</p>

<p>"Dad! Dad! You're never going to leave me behind!"</p>

<p>"Now be sensible, Gipsy! Remember all I've lost.
Your passage would be a quite unnecessary expense;
schools are better, too, over here, and you'd have more
advantages in the way of education than in South
Africa. It can't be helped, and we must both try to
make the best of it. I'll not be gone long, I promise
you that. Then I'll come back to England again and
fetch you. For goodness' sake don't make a scene!"</p>

<p>Gipsy blinked hard, and with a supreme effort contrived
to master herself. Her knockabout life had
taught her self-control and sound common sense in
many respects, and she was old enough to appreciate
the expediency of the altered plans.</p>

<p>"What school am I to go to?" she asked rather
chokily.</p>

<p>"I spoke to Captain Smith about it, and he recommended
one at a place called Greyfield. He said his
niece used to be there once, and liked it. I'm going to
take you to-day. We must get the 11.40 train."</p>

<p>"So soon! Oh, Dad! couldn't we have just one
more day together?"</p>

<p>"Impossible, Gipsy! I want to catch the mail
steamer for Cape Town to-morrow. This wreck has
been a great disaster to us. But there!&mdash;things might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
have been worse, and I suppose I shall manage to pull
my affairs round in course of time. It's no good crying
over spilt milk, is it? When one's castle comes
crashing down about one's ears, there's nothing to be
done but to set one's teeth firmly, and try to build it
up again."</p>

<p>"If only I could help you, Dad! Couldn't I help
the least little atom of a scrap out there?" pleaded
Gipsy wistfully.</p>

<p>"You'll help me best by stopping here in England,
and making yourself as happy as you can."</p>

<p>"All right! I'll try to be a Stoic! Only&mdash;we've
never been six thousand miles apart before, and&mdash;well,
it will seem queer to be left all alone in a country
where I simply don't know one single soul."</p>

<p>It was owing to the course of events just narrated
that Mr. Latimer, obliged to choose a school in a hurry,
had, on Captain Smith's recommendation, selected
Briarcroft Hall, and, taking Gipsy to Greyfield, had
arranged to leave her in Miss Poppleton's charge until
such time as he could come again and fetch her.
How she got on in her new surroundings, and how her
independent Colonial notions contrasted with more
sober English ways, it is the purpose of this story to
chronicle.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>Gipsy makes a Beginning</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Briarcroft Hall</span> was a large private school which
stood on the outskirts of the town of Greyfield, close
to the border of the Lake District in Cumberland. It
was a big, rather old-fashioned red-brick house, built
in Queen Anne style, with straight rows of windows
on either side of the front door, and a substantial
porch, surmounted by stone balls. Years ago it had
been the seat of a county magnate; but as the town
began to stretch out long, growing fingers, and rows
of villas sprang up where before had been only green
lanes, and an electric tramway was started for the convenience
of the new suburb, the owner of Briarcroft
had retreated farther afield, glad enough to escape
the proximity of unwelcome neighbours, and to let
the Hall to a suitable tenant. As Miss Poppleton announced
in her prospectuses, the house was eminently
fitted for a school: the situation was healthy, yet conveniently
near to the town, the rooms were large and
airy, the garden contained several tennis courts, and
there was a field at the back for hockey. Visiting
masters and mistresses augmented the ordinary staff
of teachers, and Greyfield was well provided with good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
swimming baths, Oxford Extension lectures, high-class
concerts, art exhibitions, and other educational privileges
not always to be met with in a provincial town.
On the other hand, the country was within easy reach.
Ten minutes' walk led on to comparatively rural roads,
and within half an hour you could find yourself beginning
to climb the fells, with a long stretch of heather
for a prospect, and the pure moorland air filling your
lungs.</div>

<p>Miss Poppleton, the Principal of the school, irreverently
nicknamed "Poppie" by her pupils, was a double
B.A., for she had taken her degree in both classics
and mathematics. She was a rather small, determined
little lady, with a bright complexion, sharp,
short-sighted, greenish-grey eyes, which peered at the
world through a pair of round rimless spectacles, but
seemed nevertheless to see everything ("too much",
the habitual sinners affirmed!), what the girls called
"an enquiring nose", grey hair brushed back quite
straight from a square, "brainy"-looking forehead,
and a mouth that had a habit of pursing and unpursing
itself very rapidly when its owner was at
all irritated or disturbed in mind. She was a good
organizer, a strict disciplinarian, and a clever teacher&mdash;everything
that is admirable, in fact, in a headmistress,
from the scholastic point of view; and her
vigorous, intellectual, capable personality always made
an excellent impression upon parents and guardians.
By the girls themselves she was regarded in a less
favourable light: the very qualities which gave her
success as a Principal caused her to seem distant and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
unapproachable. Her pupils held her in wholesome
awe, but never expanded in her presence; to them
she was the supreme authority, the "she-who-must-be-obeyed",
but not a human individual who might be met
on any common ground of mutual tastes and sympathies.</p>

<p>Miss Poppleton had a younger sister, whose name
did not appear on the prospectuses, and who took a
very back seat indeed in the school. Among intimate
friends Miss Poppleton was apt to allude to her as
"poor Edith", and most people concurred in a low
estimation of her capacities. Certainly Miss Edith
was not talented, neither would she have shone in
any walk of life requiring brains. She was the exact
opposite of her sister&mdash;tall, with big, round, blue, surprised-looking
eyes, a weak chin, and a mouth that
was generally set in a rather deprecating smile. She
held a poor opinion of herself, and was more than
willing to fill a secondary place; indeed, she would
have been both alarmed and embarrassed if called
upon to take the lead. For her elder sister she had an
admiration and devotion that amounted to reverence.
She cheerfully performed any tasks set her, and was
perfectly content to be a kind of general help and
underling, without attempting the least interference
with any of the arrangements. Critical friends sometimes
hinted that Miss Edith's position at Briarcroft
was hardly a fair one, and that Miss Poppleton took
advantage of her good nature and affection; but Miss
Edith herself never for a single instant entertained
such a disloyal notion, and continued to sing her
sister's praises almost <i>ad nauseam</i>. Among the girls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
she was a distinct favourite; her patience was endless,
and her good temper unflagging. What she lacked in
brains she made up for in warmth of heart, and though
she faithfully upheld discipline, she was apt somewhat
to tone down the severity of the rules, and indeed
sometimes surreptitiously to soften the thorny paths
of the transgressor.</p>

<p>Four resident mistresses and a certain number of
visiting teachers completed the staff at Briarcroft
Hall. The greater proportion of the pupils were day
girls, and the boarders, though they gave themselves
airs, were decidedly in the minority. Such was the
little community into which Gipsy was to be launched,
and where for many months to come she would have
to make and keep her own position.</p>

<p>Gipsy started with the most excellent intentions of
exemplary behaviour, and if her conduct, regulated
according to American codes, hardly harmonized with
Briarcroft standards, it was more her misfortune than
her fault. On the first day after her arrival she betook
herself to the Principal's study, and after a light
tap at the door, entered confidently with a breezy
"Good morning". Miss Poppleton looked up from her
papers in considerable surprise. Her private room
was sacred to herself alone, and unless armed with
a most warrantable errand nobody ever ventured to
disturb her.</p>

<p>"Who sent you here, Gipsy?" she enquired rather
sharply.</p>

<p>"Nobody," replied Gipsy, quite unaware of having
given any occasion for offence. "I only came to ask<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
leave to run out and buy a pan, and some sugar, and
a few other things. I reckon there's a store handy,
and I wouldn't be gone ten minutes. There's heaps of
time before nine."</p>

<p>Miss Poppleton gasped. She had grasped the fact,
at the beginning, that Gipsy was likely to prove an
unusual pupil, but she had not anticipated such immediate
developments.</p>

<p>"What you ask is perfectly impossible," she replied.
"The boarders here are never allowed to go out alone
to do shopping."</p>

<p>"So some of them told me last night, but I didn't
believe them. I thought they were ragging me because
I'm new, and I'd best ask at headquarters," returned
Gipsy. "I wouldn't lose my way, and I'm
accustomed to taking care of myself. I'd engage
you'd find you could trust me."</p>

<p>"That's not the question at all, Gipsy. I cannot
allow you to break school rules."</p>

<p>"Not just this once?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. If I made an exception in your
case, the others would expect the same privilege."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" said Gipsy slowly. "It seems a funny
rule to me, because in Dorcas City we might always go
to the store if we reported first."</p>

<p>"You're not in America now: you'll have to learn
English ways here, and English speech too. You
must make an effort to drop Americanisms, and talk
as we do on this side of the Atlantic."</p>

<p>Miss Poppleton's tone was rather tart, and her
mouth twitched ominously. Gipsy's eyes twinkled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll do my best," she answered brightly. "I picked
up a few words from the other girls last night that
I didn't know before. There was 'ripping' for one,
and&mdash;what was the other, now, that caught on to me?
Oh, I know!&mdash;'rotten'. I won't forget it again."</p>

<p>Miss Poppleton's face was a study.</p>

<p>"Of course I don't mean slang words like those.
The girls had no business to be using them. You
must copy the best, and not the worst."</p>

<p>"I guess it will take me a while to learn the difference."</p>

<p>"You'll have to expunge 'guess' and 'reckon' from
your vocabulary."</p>

<p>Gipsy heaved an eloquent sigh.</p>

<p>"I'll make a mental note of what I've got to avoid,
but I expect they'll slip out sometimes. But about
that pan, please! Might the janitor go out and buy it
for me? I can't make any Fudge till I get it, and I
reck&mdash;that is to say, I mean to teach those girls to
make Fudge. They've not tasted it."</p>

<p>Miss Poppleton glared at her irrepressible pupil with
a glance that would have quelled Hetty Hancock or
Lennie Chapman, but Gipsy did not flinch.</p>

<p>"They've actually never tasted Fudge!" she repeated,
with a smile of pity for their ignorance.</p>

<p>But Miss Poppleton's patience was at an end.</p>

<p>"Gipsy Latimer, understand once for all that these
things are not allowed at Briarcroft. While you are
here you will be expected to keep the rules of the
school, or, if you break them, you will be punished.
Leave my study at once, and don't report yourself
here again until you are sent for."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Gipsy left the room as requested, but she stood for
a moment or two on the doormat outside, shaking her
head solemnly.</p>

<p>"It's a bad lookout!" she said to herself. "I'm
afraid there are breakers ahead. That's not a very
difficult matter to foresee. She's got a temper! I've
not had any previous experience of English schools,
but it rather appears as if this one's run on the lines
of a reformatory. If I don't want to get myself into
trouble, I shall have to lie low, and mind what I'm
doing. Well, I've sampled the teachers, and I've
sampled the boarders. Now for the day girls and
my new Form!"</p>

<p>Gipsy had already made the acquaintance of the
elect twenty who were to be her house companions,
but that was a comparatively slight affair compared
with the ordeal of her introduction to the school as a
whole. In spite of her outward appearance of sangfroid,
she felt her heart thumping a little as she
marched into the large lecture hall for "call over". It
needs a certain courage to face seventy-two critical
strangers, and her past experience had taught her
that a new girl on her first day is like "goods on
approval", and has to run the gauntlet of public
opinion. She tried to look airy and unembarrassed,
and talked desperately to Lennie Chapman, who had
been told off to "personally conduct" her to her Form;
but all the same she was conscious that she was the
observed of all observers. It was only natural that
the little, erect, dark figure, with its bright eyes and
big scarlet hair ribbons, should attract attention.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Gipsy was about as different from the ordinary run
of British schoolgirls as a parakeet is from a flock
of pigeons; and the others were quick to note the
difference.</p>

<p>"I say, who's that foreign kid?" enquired Madeleine
Newsome, a member of the Fifth, pausing in a friendly
quarrel with a Form mate to take a quick, comprehensive
survey of the stranger's personal appearance.</p>

<p>"Can't say, I'm sure," responded Emily Atkinson,
"but we'll soon find out. Hello, you kid, what's your
name? And what part of the globe do you spring
from?"</p>

<p>"She's Spanish and American and New Zealand
and South African and several other things, and she's
been shipwrecked dozens of times," began Lennie
Chapman, who was prone to exaggerate, and liked
to act showman.</p>

<p>"Let her speak for herself," interrupted Madeleine
bluntly. "I suppose she understands English, doesn't
she? What's your name, kid? Don't stand staring
at me with those big black eyes!"</p>

<p>But here Gipsy's momentary bashfulness took flight.
Seven schools had taught her to hold her own, and she
was soon imparting information about herself with a
volubility that left no doubt of her acquaintance with
the English tongue. Other girls hurried up to listen,
and in less than a minute she was the centre of a
crowd, answering a perfect fire of questions with a
beaming good humour and a quickness of repartee
that rather took the fancy of her hearers.</p>

<p>"She's sharp enough, at any rate," commented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Mary Parsons. "Not very easy to take a rise out of
her, I should think."</p>

<p>"Awfully pretty, I call her," responded Joyce Adamson.
"Those big red bows are immense in more ways
than one."</p>

<p>"She's not the sort to play second fiddle evidently,"
grumbled Maude Helm a trifle enviously. "New girls
oughtn't to have such cheek, in my opinion. When I
was new&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! We all remember how you stood looking
black thunders, and no one could drag a single
word out of you, not even your name! Can't see
where the sense came in! I like a girl with plenty
to say for herself."</p>

<p>"This one's got enough, at any rate!" snapped
Maude. "She talks away like a Cheap-Jack. Now
if I were&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, can't you? I want to hear
what she's saying."</p>

<p>"What Form's she in?"</p>

<p>"I believe Poppie's put her in the Upper Fourth."</p>

<p>"Hush! Here's Poppie herself!"</p>

<p>As the Principal stepped upon the platform and
rang the bell, the girls hastily scurried to their seats,
deferring further catechism of their new schoolfellow
till eleven o'clock. Gipsy's name had been placed on
the roll call of the Upper Fourth, so as a member of
the Lower School she marched in the long line that
filed from the lecture hall to the right-hand wing of
the house. The preliminary part of her ordeal might
be considered successfully over. Schoolgirls are quick<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
to take likes and dislikes; with them, first impressions
are everything, and a few minutes are often sufficient
to decide the fate of a newcomer. By the end of the
day Gipsy had won golden opinions; her whimsical
humour and free Colonial manners, however unfavourably
they might impress Miss Poppleton, pleased the
popular taste, and except by an envious few she was
pronounced "ripping". Even Helen Roper, the head
of the school, condescended to notice her.</p>

<p>"Hello, you new girl!" she said patronizingly, "you
may join our Needlework Guild if you like. You've
got to subscribe a shilling, and promise to make a
garment every year. They're sent to the hospitals,
you know."</p>

<p>"Thanks," replied Gipsy, not too utterly overwhelmed
by the honour. "I'm a bad sewer, but I
dare say I'd manage to cobble up something."</p>

<p>"Then I'll put your name down, and you can bring
me the shilling to-morrow. Have you got a camera?
Then I expect you'll like to belong to the Photographic Guild&mdash;the
subscription's a shilling for that
too. Remind me to give you a card of the rules if
I forget."</p>

<p>"You'll do!" whispered Lennie Chapman, who had
watched over Gipsy's introduction with anxious
interest. "If Helen Roper's spoken to you, you're
sure to get on. You'll join the Guilds, of course?
There's the Dramatic as well, and the Musical, and
the Athletic."</p>

<p>"If they want a shilling for each, it will soon run
away with one's pocket-money," laughed Gipsy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, yes, so it does, but then one has to join. It
is the thing to do."</p>

<p>"I don't mind the subscriptions if the Guilds are
fun."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;um! I can't say they're very much fun
for us. We're only Lower School, you see, and we
don't get a look-in."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course it's all in the hands of the Sixth.
They arrange everything. We mayn't so much as
express an opinion."</p>

<p>"No, it's really rather too bad," said Hetty Hancock,
joining in the conversation. "We Lower School
aren't fairly treated. The Photographic Guild spent
all the society's money on a gorgeous developing
machine last term, and no one's allowed to use it
except the Committee."</p>

<p>"But aren't any of the Lower School on the Committee?"
asked Gipsy.</p>

<p>"No, we're not counted 'eligible'. We vote, but
we may only elect members of the Sixth. And the
Sixth just have it all their own way."</p>

<p>"How monstrously unfair!"</p>

<p>"It's just as bad in the Dramatic," continued Hetty,
airing her grievances. "The Sixth arrange all the
casts, and of course take the best parts for themselves,
and only give us Juniors little, unimportant bits."</p>

<p>"But don't the Lower School act plays by themselves?"</p>

<p>"They haven't, so far; you see, it's always been
one big Society. But I can tell you we've grumbled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
when our subscriptions have all gone to buy wigs and
costumes for the Sixth."</p>

<p>"But why do you let them?" protested Gipsy.</p>

<p>Hetty shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"How are we going to prevent it, when we've no
voice in the matter? I told you the Committee
arrange everything. We're supposed to be allowed
to give our views at the General Meeting, but it's the
merest farce&mdash;the Sixth won't condescend to listen
to us."</p>

<p>"I'd make them listen!" said Gipsy indignantly.</p>

<p>"You'd better try, then!" laughed Hetty. "It's the
Annual Meeting of all the Guilds on Friday week.
We have to elect officers for the year. I should like
to see you tackle Helen Roper!"</p>

<p>Gipsy turned away without further comment. Her
past experience of schools had taught her that it was
unwise to begin by criticizing well-worn institutions
too soon. During the next few days, however, she
asked many questions, and by diligently putting two
and two together managed to arrive at a tolerably
accurate estimate of the general state of affairs. The
result caused her to shake her head. Though she
said little, like the proverbial parrot she thought the
more, and her thoughts gradually shaped themselves
into a plan of action. At the end of a week she faced
the situation.</p>

<p>"Look here, Gipsy Latimer!" she said to herself,
"there are abuses in this school that need reforming.
Somebody's got to take the matter up, and I guess
it's your mission to do it! I don't believe it's ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
occurred to those girls to make a stand for their
rights. They may support you, or they may call
you an interfering busybody for your pains; you'll
have to take your chance of that. With your free-born
democratic standards, it's impossible for you to
sit still and see things go on as they are. This
annual meeting's your opportunity, so you'd best
pluck up your courage and nerve yourself for the
fray."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>A Mass Meeting</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">A large</span> school is a state in miniature. Quite apart
from the rule of the mistresses, it has its own particular
institutions and its own system of self-government.
In their special domain its officers are of quite as much
importance as Members of Parliament, and wield an
influence and an authority comparable to that of
Cabinet Ministers. Tyrannies, struggles for freedom,
minor corruptions, and hot debates have their places
here as well as in the wider world of politics, and
many an amateur "Home Rule Bill" is defeated or
carried according to the circumstances of the case.
At Briarcroft Hall there had hitherto existed a pure
oligarchy, or government of the few. The Sixth Form
had jealously kept the reins in their own hands, and,
while granting a few privileges to the Fifth, had
denied the slightest right of interference to the Lower
School. So far, though the Juniors had grumbled
continually, they had never taken any steps to redress
their grievances. Here and there one of them would
offer an indignant protest, which was treated with
scorn by the Seniors, and things would go on again
in the old unsatisfactory fashion.</div>

<p>Gipsy, with the unbiased judgment of an entirely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
new-comer, had formed her opinion of the Briarcroft
code, and deeming reform necessary, set to work to
preach a crusade. She expounded her views to Hetty
Hancock, Lennie Chapman, and a few other sympathizers,
and organized a plan of campaign.</p>

<p>"What we want to do is to combine," she announced.
"It's not the slightest scrap of good a few single girls
going and airing their woes to the Sixth. They're not
likely to listen. If we could show them that the whole
of the Lower School is one big united body, pledged
to resist,&mdash;well, they'd just have to give way."</p>

<p>"All the lower Forms feel the same," said Hetty.
"I was speaking to the Third about it this morning."</p>

<p>"How are we going to begin?" asked Lennie.</p>

<p>"We must call a mass meeting of Juniors, and put
the thing to them fairly and squarely," said Gipsy.
"Explain what we want, and draw up a programme
of what we mean to do, then see if they'll give their
support."</p>

<p>"Best lose no time about it, then. I'll post up
notices at once, and we'll have a meeting at two o'clock
to-morrow afternoon in the play-room. It's no use
letting the grass grow under our feet. Have you a
pencil and a scrap of paper there, Lennie? Give
them to me, and I'll make a rough draft. How will
this do, do you think?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'A Mass Meeting of all Members of the Lower
School will be held in the Junior Play-room on
Wednesday at 2 p.m. prompt. Business: To consider
the question of readjusting the Management
of the various Guilds.</p>

<div class='sig'>
"'Speaker: GIPSY LATIMER.'"<br />
</div>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"First rate!" said Lennie. "I'll help you to make
some copies. We must pin one up on the notice
board of each Junior classroom, and one in the dressing-room.
It'll make a stir, and no mistake!"</p>

<p>"Rather!" chuckled Hetty. "Gipsy, you're an
Oliver Cromwell!"</p>

<p>"You might add: 'Chairman, Hetty Hancock', then
I guess it will do," said Gipsy, scanning the scrap of
paper.</p>

<p>As Lennie had prophesied, the announcement caused
a great stir throughout the Lower School. Excited
girls crowded round the notices discussing the question,
and for that day the talk was of nothing else.
Gipsy had rather taken the popular fancy; and though
a few considered it impertinence on the part of a new
girl to offer any criticisms on existing institutions, all
were anxious to hear what she had to say on so
absorbing a topic. At 2 p.m. on the Wednesday,
therefore, the play-room was crowded. Juniors of all
sorts and conditions were there, from the tall girls
of the Upper Fourth to giggling members of the
Third, and small fry of the First and Second, who
felt themselves vastly important at being included in
the proceedings. The instigators of the movement
were determined that the meeting should be held in
strict order. They had placed a table to serve as a
platform, and arranged benches that would accommodate
at least a part of the audience.</p>

<p>"Lennie, you make them take their seats properly,"
commanded Hetty; "big ones at the back, and little
ones in front: those First Form kids can sit on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
floor. Don't stand any nonsense with the Third.
Now, Gipsy, are you ready? Then we'll mount the
platform."</p>

<p>Hetty had been studying up her duties as "Chairman",
and was anxious to do the thing in style. She
had prepared her speech carefully beforehand.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," she began glibly, "at least,
I mean girls and fellow members of our Junior School,
my pleasant business this afternoon is to introduce
to you the speaker, Miss Gipsy Latimer. Though she
is a newcomer amongst us, I'm sure we all realize
that by her wide experience of American and Colonial
schools she is particularly fitted to speak to us on the
subject in hand. She has had the opportunity of
studying the working of other Societies and Guilds,
and she will no doubt be able to offer us many valuable
suggestions. I will not take up the time of the
meeting by any further remarks, but will at once call
upon the speaker to address us."</p>

<p>Hetty sat down, consciously covered with glory.
Her own Form cheered lustily, and even the unruly
Third appeared much impressed. The little girls in
the front row were staring round-eyed and open-mouthed
with admiration. Gipsy rose slowly, took
one long, comprehensive glance over her audience,
then in her clear, high-pitched tones began her
crusade:</p>

<p>"Girls! I'm afraid most of you will think it's rather
cheeky of me to have taken the matter up when I've
only been ten days or so at Briarcroft, and I'd like at
the very start to apologize for what really must look<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
to you like a piece of cocksure presumption. I think
you'll all allow, though, that it's a pretty true saying
that 'outsiders see most of the game'. I've been
examining your institutions pretty carefully since I
came, and it seems to me the game's all in the hands
of the Sixth. There are five separate Guilds in this
school&mdash;the Needlework, the Photographic, the Dramatic,
the Musical, and the Athletic. I made enquiries
about all of them, and I find that though the
Juniors contribute the bulk of the subscriptions, they
haven't the least voice in the arrangements. Now,
in the countries I've lived in, such a state of affairs
would be denounced as tyranny pure and simple. I
reckon a school ought to be a democracy, and every
member who joins a society and pays a subscription
has a right to have some say at least in the way
the subscriptions are to be spent. If they don't, it's
'taxation without representation', a bad old mediaeval
custom that it's taken some countries a revolution to
get rid of. I put it to the meeting&mdash;Are you willing
to sit down and be tyrannized over by the Sixth?
Do you mean to go on paying your shillings, and
never getting the least advantage or satisfaction out
of any of the Guilds?"</p>

<p>An indignant roar of "No, no!" came from the
audience. Gipsy had stated the case very clearly.
It was what the Juniors had all felt, but had never
fairly voiced before. They wanted to hear more.</p>

<p>"Go on! Go on!" they cried eagerly.</p>

<p>"There are at present ninety-three girls in this
school," continued Gipsy. "Twenty-two are in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Fifth and Sixth, and seventy-one in the lower Forms.
Just compare those figures! Twenty-two Seniors and
seventy-one Juniors! Why, our majority is simply
overwhelming. Now, for an example let us take the
Dramatic Guild. At a shilling a year a head, the
subscriptions of the Upper School amount to &pound;1, 2<i>s.</i>,
and those of the Lower School to &pound;3, 11<i>s.</i> I asked
how last year's funds were spent, and found the
whole went in hiring Pompadour wigs and other
things that were worn by the Sixth. Only three
Juniors took part in the performances, and they were
actually obliged to provide their own costumes, because
there was no money left to buy materials. Now,
I ask you, is such a state of affairs to be tolerated any
longer?"</p>

<p>"No!" shrieked a chorus of voices.</p>

<p>"The Dramatic Guild is no exception. All the
other societies are equally bad. The funds ought to
be applied to the general good; and if they're only
spent on a few, I call it misappropriation of a trust.
In America and in the Colonies our watchword was
always 'Liberty'; and we took care that all got their
rights. Are you Briarcroft girls going to let this injustice
go on, or will you all join together and make
a stand for fair practices? In the name of Liberty, I
ask you!"</p>

<p>As Gipsy warmed to her subject her brown eyes
flashed and sparkled, and the whole of her dark face
seemed afire with enthusiasm. She looked a convincing
little figure as she stood there, urging the rights
of her schoolfellows, and hardly a girl in the room<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
but was carried away by her arguments. Instinctively
the Juniors felt they had found a leader.</p>

<span class="caption">THE LOWER SCHOOL FIND A LEADER</span>
</div>

<p>"I put it to the meeting. Are you ready to combine
and stand together? Those who are in favour,
kindly hold up their hands."</p>

<p>Such a clamour arose from the play-room that the
noise drifted upstairs to the ears of the Seniors, who
sat all unconscious of the rebellion that was being
preached below. With memories of Wat Tyler,
Hampden, Oliver Cromwell, the Seven Bishops, and
other famous champions of the commonweal fresh in
their minds from their history books, the girls were
ready to take any measures suggested to them. There
was scarcely a dissenting voice. Enthusiasm fires
enthusiasm. Gipsy's speech seemed an inspiration,
and everybody was agog with interest.</p>

<p>"She's right!"</p>

<p>"We've been kept down too long!"</p>

<p>"I always said it was monstrously unfair!"</p>

<p>"The Seniors will have to give way!"</p>

<p>"We'll get our rights now!"</p>

<p>"I wonder nobody thought of it before!"</p>

<p>The talk burst out on all sides, for every one was
eager to have her own say, and discuss the matter
with her neighbour. Even the First Form children
had followed the arguments, and were as keen as
anybody. Gipsy calmly counted the upraised hands,
then rang a bell for silence.</p>

<p>"I may take it, then, that the motion is carried by
the general consent of the meeting," she continued.
"We're agreed that some stand ought to be made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
against the aggressions of the Seniors. Now, the
next question to be considered is what we mean to
do, and how we're going to do it. It seems to me
that we ought to have something very definite to
work upon. What I propose is that a picked few of
us go as delegates to the Sixth, and ask for something
that has always been refused before. If, as I expect,
they say 'No', then we shall have a just ground of
complaint, and we'll use it as a text at the Annual
Meeting to demand a new arrangement of the Guilds.
Four of us ought to make up the deputation. I'm
willing to go for one, and I think I can promise for
Hetty Hancock and Lennie Chapman. Who'll volunteer
to be the fourth?"</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence. It was all very well
to shout rebellion in chorus, but the old tradition of
awe for the Sixth still oppressed the Juniors, when it
came to the point of openly bearding the lions in
question.</p>

<p>"I will!" said a voice from the back row.</p>

<p>It was Meg Gordon, a member of the Upper Fourth,
a rather nice-looking girl of about Gipsy's own age.
Meg had listened with closest attention and wholehearted
agreement, and was prepared to embrace the
cause with the zeal she considered it deserved. If
called upon to do so, she would have been ready even
to face Miss Poppleton herself.</p>

<p>"Good!" replied Gipsy. "Then we'll make up a
test case. If it's refused, then we draw up a statement
of our grievances, and what we want reformed,
and present it at the General Meeting. If that's also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
refused&mdash;" (Gipsy paused a moment to let her words
take due effect) "then we show our teeth!"</p>

<p>"What's our programme then?" shouted one of the
Lower Fourth.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you. If the Seniors have shown themselves
unworthy of our confidence, they don't deserve our
support in any respect. Instead of voting to elect
them as officers, we'll withdraw our subscriptions, and
found a separate system of Guilds for the Lower
School alone."</p>

<p>The boldness of Gipsy's suggestion almost took
away the breath of her hearers. To break loose
from the hard regime of the Seniors and form a
system of self-governing societies among the Juniors
had never occurred to anybody at Briarcroft before.
The idea was splendid in its magnitude.</p>

<p>"It seems to me we've got the game into our own
hands if we like," continued the speaker. "Nobody
can force us to subscribe to societies of which we don't
approve. We'll insist on a referendum of the whole
school, and see how the result turns out. Are you
all ready to combine on this point? Those in favour,
please say 'Aye'."</p>

<p>"Aye! Aye! Aye!" arose from all sides.</p>

<p>"Well spoken!"</p>

<p>"Hurrah for the Junior School!"</p>

<p>"Three cheers for Gipsy Latimer!" shouted Hetty
Hancock, jumping up agitatedly from her chair, and
nearly falling over the edge of the platform in the
heat of her enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Hear, Hear!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hip, hip, hip, hooray!"</p>

<p>The excitement was intense. Gipsy's oratory had
been quite spontaneous and unaffected, and like most
genuine things it carried conviction to its hearers. In
the midst of a babel of voices the big bell rang for
afternoon school. The girls fled to their various
classrooms, discussing the matter on their way upstairs.</p>

<p>"It's the best idea I've ever heard!" declared Meg
Gordon. "Gipsy Latimer's a trump! I'll support her
in anything she proposes."</p>

<p>"I wonder we never thought of such a thing before,"
said Cassie Bertram.</p>

<p>"Yes, to think of our having stood the Sixth for
years, and never making a move!"</p>

<p>"I think it ought to have come from some of us,
though," objected Maude Helm. "Gipsy's quite a new
girl, and it's rather cheek of her to try and foist her
American notions upon us, as if we didn't know anything."</p>

<p>"Oh, you shut up! Why didn't you suggest it yourself?"</p>

<p>"I'm rather of Maude's opinion," said Alice O'Connor.
"I agree with the thing in principle, but I don't like
it coming from a new girl."</p>

<p>"New girls oughtn't to run the whole show," added
Gladys Merriman.</p>

<p>"Oh, you three! You'd find fault with an angel!
For goodness' sake don't get up these petty little
jealousies, and spoil the whole affair. What does it
matter if Gipsy's new? Everybody has to be new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
some time. She's shown she's capable of a great
deal more than most of us are."</p>

<p>"And she knows it too, doesn't she just?" sneered
Maude. "The way she stood on that platform and
talked!"</p>

<p>"It's sheer nastiness on your part, Maude Helm, to
try and belittle her! You won't get much glory for
yourself by sticking pins in other people; and I can
tell you, if you're going to set up in opposition to
Gipsy, you've no chance. I'll undertake there's hardly
a girl in the Lower School now who won't side with
Gipsy Latimer!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>A Pitched Battle</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Gipsy</span> ran upstairs to the classroom with a feeling of
intense satisfaction. So far all had gone well. She
had succeeded in arousing a spirit of righteous wrath
and resistance throughout the Lower School, and a
desire to combine for the general welfare. There was
a certain exhilaration in the discovery that she was
thus able to sway the minds of her companions. She
had been popular in other schools, but she had never
had a chance such as this. To do Gipsy justice, however,
she thought far more of the cause she had taken
up than of her own popularity. "Fairness" was her
watchword, and wherever her lot had been cast she
would have come forward as the champion of any
whom she considered unfairly treated. A girl of
decided ability, her knockabout life had in many
ways made her old beyond her years, and she had
that capacity for organization and power of making
others work with her that belong to the born leader.
Having constituted herself practically head of the
movement, she assumed the further conduct of affairs,
and at four o'clock held a small committee meeting
with Hetty Hancock, Lennie Chapman, and Meg
Gordon, her three self-elected coadjutors. As the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
result of their consultations they presented themselves
next day in the Sixth Form classroom, at the
identical moment when Miss Giles had just retired,
and the members of the Sixth were still engaged in
putting away their books.</div>

<p>"Hello, you kids! What are you doing here?" exclaimed
Doreen Tristram. "Just you quit, and be
quick about it, too!"</p>

<p>"Kids, indeed!" retorted Hetty Hancock. "Not
much kids about us, I should think. We're all turned
fourteen."</p>

<p>"Are you really? What a magnificent age! I'm
glad you've enlightened me, for I should certainly
have classed you among the babes!" returned Doreen
sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Define a kid!" drawled Esther Hughes, putting on
her pince-nez to regard the intruders.</p>

<p>"Everybody knows a kid means a First or Second
Form-er, sometimes a Third, but never, never a Fourth
Form girl!" burst out Lennie Chapman indignantly.
"Why, I'm taller than you!"</p>

<p>The Seniors giggled.</p>

<p>"Merely a difference of opinion, my child," said Ada
Dawkins. "Now, according to our standard, every
member of the Lower School is a kid, even if she were
six feet in height! Our superiority lies in brains, not
inches! All Juniors are kids, you are a Junior, therefore
you must be a kid. <i>Quod est demonstrandum!</i>"</p>

<p>"And kids aren't allowed to poke their impertinent
young noses into our Form room," said Doreen
Tristram. "I told you before to quit!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you want to be turned out by brute force?"
added Gertrude Harding. "It would be an undignified
exit, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>Despite the threat, none of the four delegates budged
an inch.</p>

<p>"You say what we're here for," whispered Meg,
nudging Gipsy.</p>

<p>Thus urged, Gipsy opened her campaign:</p>

<p>"We're all four members of the Photographic Guild,
and we've come to ask for the developing machine.
Some of us in the Fourth want to use it."</p>

<p>"In-deed! I dare say you do!"</p>

<p>"Don't you wish you may get it, that's all!"</p>

<p>"Cheek!"</p>

<p>"Look here&mdash;clear out of our classroom!"</p>

<p>"Not until I've asked a few questions," returned
Gipsy firmly. "Is the developing machine the property
of the Photographic Guild?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it is," grudgingly admitted Ada Dawkins.</p>

<p>"Then why aren't all members allowed to use it?"</p>

<p>"Because we're not going to have it spoilt by kids'
meddlesome fingers. That's the reason, and a very
good one too!"</p>

<p>"The Juniors pay their subscriptions as well as the
Seniors, so they've a right to everything that's the
common property of the Guild," persisted Gipsy.</p>

<p>"No, they haven't!" snapped Helen Roper, the head
girl. "Nobody but members of the Committee has
a right to anything. If you think we're going to let
you Juniors come interfering, you're just mistaken,
and the sooner you undeceive yourselves the better."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"We only want our rights."</p>

<p>"Rights? You've got no rights! It's privilege
enough for you to be allowed to belong to the Guild
at all."</p>

<p>"A great privilege to pay our shillings!"</p>

<p>"You're allowed to vote, you know," put in Lena
Morris, who possibly had heard a hint of what was
brewing in the Lower School. "You can elect any
of us as officers that you like, for any of the Guilds."</p>

<p>"And much good that is, when you all play into
one another's hands!" burst out Gipsy. "Who gets the
best parts in the Dramatic and the Musical, I should
like to know? Who votes the prizes in the Sports?"</p>

<p>Helen Roper turned rather red. The difference in
the qualities of the prizes offered to Seniors and
Juniors in the last athletic contest had been so
marked as to call forth comment from the mistresses.</p>

<p>"That's nothing to do with it," she faltered rather
lamely. "If you Juniors have any complaints to
make, you must make them at the Annual Meeting."</p>

<p>"We're going to," said Hetty Hancock grimly.</p>

<p>"Then in the meantime keep to your own quarters,
and don't intrude yourselves where you've no business,"
commanded Doreen Tristram angrily. "Do
you intend to take yourselves off peaceably, or must
we eject you?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, we'll go now. We've found out all we
want to know, and it hardly reflects to your credit."</p>

<p>So saying, Gipsy and her confederates stalked away
with what dignity they could muster.</p>

<p>Once outside the door they tore along the passage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and downstairs to the Junior dressing-room, where,
collecting all available members of the Lower School,
they promptly held an informal indignation meeting.</p>

<p>"Only what everyone expected!" said Dilys Fenton.</p>

<p>"Trust the Sixth not to give in a single inch!"</p>

<p>"They've been asked heaps of times before."</p>

<p>"Then it adds another nail to their coffin," declared
Gipsy. "We've tried them fairly, and they've refused
to act fairly. We'll give them one more chance at the
meeting to-morrow, and if they won't accept our
terms&mdash;then we'll break loose and be off on our own.
Are you all agreed to that?"</p>

<p>"Rather! We'll stand no nonsense this time."</p>

<p>"Kids, indeed! We'll show them what kids can
do."</p>

<p>"They'll get on pretty badly without the kids."</p>

<p>"We'll soon let them find that out!"</p>

<p>If the Seniors had received any warning of what
was in the wind, they did not take the matter seriously.
From time immemorial the Juniors had always complained,
and no notice had ever been taken of their complaints.
As Juniors themselves the Sixth had grumbled
at former head girls and monitresses, but now that they
had reached the elect position of the top Form, they
had reversed their old opinions. It had always been
the tradition of Briarcroft that all authority should be
vested in the Seniors, and they saw no reason why
it should be changed. A mere outburst of temper on
the part of a few Juniors was nothing: it had happened
before, and would no doubt happen again; it
was as much the province of Juniors to grumble as of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Seniors to rule. But they reckoned without Gipsy.
That any girl of her age should be capable of welding
the shifting dissatisfaction of the Lower School into
one solid mass of opposition had never occurred to
them. So far no Junior had exercised any particular
influence over her fellows; it had been each for herself,
even in clamouring appeals for privileges, and the
upper girls looked down on the "kids" as a noisy,
selfish, troublesome crew, to be kept well under, and
not worthy of very much consideration.</p>

<p>The Annual Meeting of the Guilds was to take
place on Friday, 15 October, at three o'clock, in the
lecture hall. It was held every year on the Friday
nearest to the middle of October, and by old-established
custom the last hour of the afternoon was
allowed to be devoted to it. The mistresses were
never present, and the girls, under the superintendence
of the monitresses, were permitted to make any
arrangements they thought fit, so long as they did
not interfere with the ordinary school rules. Though
the meetings had begun in good faith, as representative
assemblies for all alike, they had degenerated
into a merely formal statement of accounts by the
Committee, which the general rank and file were expected
to pass without comment, and an election of
officers chosen almost entirely from the monitresses.
There were favourites, of course, among the candidates,
but their number was so limited that they did not even
take the trouble to canvass for votes, each one feeling
nearly sure of being elected to fill one, if not more, of
the numerous posts in the many Guilds. The Fifth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
having secured certain privileges denied to Juniors,
were content if a few of their number were chosen to
supply minor vacancies, and rarely interfered with the
main direction of affairs.</p>

<p>On the Friday afternoon, therefore, the Upper
School strolled carelessly into the lecture hall, and
took their seats with the air of having a perfunctory
business to perform which they would be glad to get
over. The Juniors, on the other hand, were in a ferment
of excitement: their opportunity had arrived,
and they intended to make the most of it; even the
youngsters of the First Form were grim in their determination
to resist. The proceedings began in the
ordinary time-honoured fashion. Helen Roper read
a report for the previous year, and a statement of
accounts. The latter, having been audited by Miss
Poppleton and found correct, was passed without demur,
and the head girl then went on to announce the
list of candidates for the various offices. She rattled
off the whole in a rather supercilious, casual manner,
and she finished with the usual formula: "If any
member of the Society has an objection to raise or
a suggestion to make, kindly put it before the meeting
now, that it may be discussed before the voting
begins."</p>

<p>She paused for a moment with a bored air, expecting
to hear the old grievances, and to squash them in
the old summary fashion. The thing, to her, was a
mere farce, to be gone through as speedily as possible.
The eyes of all the Juniors were turned upon Gipsy,
and Gipsy stood up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the name of the whole of the Lower School
I have an objection to raise and a suggestion to
make," she began, in her clear, high-pitched voice.
"We Juniors consider that we are unfairly treated
in many ways in the Guilds, and we demand that a
certain number of us should be eligible to serve on
the Committee, to look after the rights of our own
Forms."</p>

<p>Helen Roper stared at Gipsy as if she could hardly
believe the evidence of her own ears, and the Seniors
gasped with astonishment. The impudence of the
proposal seemed to them beyond all bounds.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's not exactly the province of Juniors
to sit on the Committee," returned Helen, with a sarcastic
smile. "You can hardly expect us to comply
with that demand."</p>

<p>"Cheek!"</p>

<p>"Sit upon her!"</p>

<p>"We can't allow this kind of thing!" murmured the
indignant Seniors.</p>

<p>"A Guild is supposed to be formed for the common
benefit of all concerned," continued Gipsy. "And I
contend that every member who pays a subscription
has a right to fair representation."</p>

<p>"Hear, hear!" shouted the Juniors.</p>

<p>"Well, you are represented. You can vote for any
candidate you like," snapped Helen.</p>

<p>"But it is not fair representation when the candidates
are obliged to be chosen from the ranks of the
opposite camp. We want candidates of our own, to
look after Lower School interests."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"We'll have them too!" squeaked a shrill voice
from the ranks of the Third Form.</p>

<p>"You're not going to get it all your own way!"
yelled another.</p>

<p>"We're tired of tyranny."</p>

<p>"Order! Order!" commanded Helen; then, turning
to her fellow monitresses, she held a brief whispered
consultation.</p>

<p>"Stop it at once!" "Put it down firmly!" "Don't
stand any nonsense from them!" "Show them who
are their betters," was the hasty advice given, and
she turned again to the excited Juniors.</p>

<p>"What you ask is impossible," she said imperiously.
"The Guilds have gone on very well in the past, and
they'll go on very well in the future. We promise
that the interests of the Juniors shall be looked after,
but the general management must remain as before.
You can sit down, Gipsy Latimer."</p>

<p>But Gipsy did not sit down.</p>

<p>"I've made a fair request, and you've refused it,"
she continued calmly. "All that remains for me to
do now is to appeal to the whole school. We Juniors
have held a meeting amongst ourselves, and have
decided that, if we're denied our just rights, we'll
withdraw our subscriptions and found Guilds of our
own. Am I voicing the public opinion?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" roared the Juniors.</p>

<p>"Put it to the vote!"</p>

<p>"Have it in black and white!"</p>

<p>"We'll settle it to-day!"</p>

<p>Gipsy's ultimatum was so utterly unexpected that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the Seniors looked at one another as if an earthquake
had occurred. They had imagined it was all "bluff"
on the part of the younger girls, and that they were
quite incapable of enforcing their demands. This
sudden mutiny was a crisis such as had never risen
before.</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better yield a point, and let them have
one or two candidates of their own?" suggested Lena
Morris hastily.</p>

<p>"Certainly not! It would be the greatest mistake
to give way. Leave me to deal with them," said
Helen, and turning on the Juniors with flashing eyes,
she poured forth her scorn.</p>

<p>"Guilds of your own, indeed! Nice Guilds they'd
be! Why, the meetings would be bear gardens.
What do you know about how to conduct a Society?
When I was a Junior I trusted to the wisdom of the
Seniors, instead of listening to every newcomer who
talked frothy nonsense. I tell you, it is the monitresses
who are your best friends, and who can decide
what's good for you. Are you going to change the
whole of our Briarcroft organizations at the bidding
of a girl who has only been in the school ten
days?"</p>

<p>The latter part of Helen's argument appealed to
a few who were jealous of Gipsy's influence, but the
greater number broke out in indignant protest.</p>

<p>"Friends indeed!"</p>

<p>"Pretty friends!"</p>

<p>"Tyrants, more likely!"</p>

<p>"We'll see about bear gardens!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"We won't be sat upon by a clique!"</p>

<p>These and other remarks were shouted in reply.
Some of the excited girls scrambled up and stood on
their seats; each began to talk to her neighbour, and
the noise swelled till it grew into a general roar of:
"A referendum! Give us a referendum!"</p>

<p>Helen rang the bell for silence, and, when some sort
of order was restored, once more faced the turbulent
Juniors.</p>

<p>"Do I clearly understand what it is you want to
put to the vote?" she asked, frowning.</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes! Tell her again, Gipsy!"</p>

<p>"I may be a new girl," said Gipsy, "but the others
have chosen me to speak for them, so I'm their lawful
delegate. What we want to vote about is a question
of separation. Are we Juniors to keep on in the
old Guilds, or start Guilds of our own?"</p>

<p>"It will have to be a referendum of both Seniors
and Juniors," replied Helen sharply.</p>

<p>"That's only fair. This is a public Annual Meeting,
and we want to do everything in order."</p>

<p>Helen conferred again with her own Form. By all
rules of general meetings, it was impossible to refuse
a referendum if called for. They were obliged, therefore,
to submit with the best grace they could, and to
deal out the voting papers.</p>

<p>"Those in favour of union with the present Guilds
kindly put a nought, and those in favour of separation
a cross," commanded Helen. "Any paper with anything
more on it will be disqualified. Girls! I make
a last appeal to you to remember our old traditions,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and to resist these innovations. Be loyal to your
monitresses!"</p>

<p>"Old traditions are sometimes bad traditions," exclaimed
Hetty Hancock, metaphorically flinging back
the gauntlet. "We're ready to obey our monitresses on
questions of school rules, but we're not Saxon serfs.
Fair play is a jewel! We Juniors haven't had it yet,
and we mean to get it. Girls! Be loyal to the Lower
School!"</p>

<p>The Juniors snatched their voting papers with hot
eagerness, and for a moment or two there was a silence
in the room, while the necessary noughts or crosses
were being registered. The Seniors were feeling decidedly
blue, but for <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'appearance'">appearances</ins>' sake they kept up
a show of confidence.</p>

<p>"I think one of us is entitled to help to check the
counting," said Hetty, as the papers were collected
and handed to the monitresses.</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly! Please come and satisfy yourselves,"
returned Helen bitterly.</p>

<p>So the votes were counted by Lena Morris and Ada
Dawkins on behalf of the Seniors, and by Hetty and
Gipsy on behalf of the Juniors. The latter had not
doubted the result, but to the Upper School the figures
were startling:</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Votes">
<tr><td align='left'>Separation</td><td align='right'>65</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Union</td><td align='right'><span class='u'>28</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Majority for Separation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align='right'>37</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Only six of the younger girls, therefore, had voted
for the old regime, and the victory of the Lower<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
School was complete. A mad scene of triumph ensued.
The Juniors clapped and cheered, and waved
their handkerchiefs in the exuberance of their enthusiasm;
and as the discomfited Seniors beat a hasty
retreat, the meeting broke up amid the roar of exultant
hurrahs, and an impromptu chorus started by
Gipsy and taken up by a dozen jubilant voices:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Rule, Britannia! Britannia rules the waves!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Juniors never, never, never, will be slaves!"</span><br />

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>American Fudge</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> events narrated in the last chapter had made an
epoch in Briarcroft history. Henceforward the Lower
School meant to manage its own affairs, and it set
to work at once to settle things upon a firm basis.
Needless to say, Gipsy was the heroine of the hour.
Except for a half-dozen who envied her popularity,
the girls recognized that the revolution was entirely
owed to her suggestion, and they were ready to
acknowledge her as their leader. She took her
honours modestly. Having accomplished what she
had aimed at, she was quite ready to retire from the
position of dictator until some other good cause needed
a champion. After several meetings and much discussion,
the Juniors decided that instead of founding
a number of separate societies for photography, athletics,
acting, &amp;c., they would institute one united
Guild, which should include all the various forms of
school activity, to be covered by one subscription,
payable each term.</div>

<p>"It will be far better than dividing things up,"
said Hetty Hancock, "because sometimes we want
to spend more on one thing than on another, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
it's awkward to have to vote the funds of the Photographic
Society over to the Dramatic, or vice versa.
I think we should manage all right this way. We
must elect a Committee, of course, and officers. For
President, I beg to nominate Gipsy Latimer. She
deserves it."</p>

<p>"Yes! Gipsy! Gipsy!" agreed the girls.</p>

<p>But Gipsy shook her head, and like Oliver Cromwell
waved away the tempting offer of a crown.</p>

<p>"No," she said firmly; "I've only been a fortnight
in the school, and I don't feel up to the post. Better
choose someone as President who understands Briarcroft
ways better than I do. I suggest Dilys Fenton.
She's the oldest girl in the Upper Fourth, and from
what I hear she's been here one of the longest. I'll
serve on the Committee, if you like, and be of any use
I can, but you want an old-established Briarcroft-ite
as President. I don't know any of your arrangements
yet about cricket or tennis, and I should always be
making mistakes."</p>

<p>The wisdom of Gipsy's remarks appealed to the
girls. It was certainly more suitable to choose as
President somebody who understood the school ways.
They appreciated the motive of her refusal, however;
and her generosity in thus standing aside made her,
if anything, more popular than before. They insisted
upon electing her to the post of Secretary.</p>

<p>"You can keep the accounts, and read aloud the
minutes of the meetings, and all those sorts of business
things better than anybody," declared Hetty.</p>

<p>"If I don't happen to forget which country I'm in,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and add things up as cents and dollars, instead of
pence and shillings!" laughed Gipsy.</p>

<p>"We'll soon pull you up if you do, never fear!"</p>

<p>Now that her crusade was successfully accomplished,
Gipsy settled down to enjoy life at Briarcroft as well
as the limited circumstances permitted. She had already
made several warm friends among both the
boarders and the day girls. Meg Gordon in particular
was inclined to accord her that species of hero worship
often indulged in by schoolgirls. She brought
offerings of late roses or autumn violets from home,
and followed her idol about the school like a love-sick
swain. She would sit gazing at Gipsy during
classes in deepest admiration, and was ready to accept
her every idea as gospel. Meg was rather a curious,
abrupt girl in many ways, and though she had been
a year at Briarcroft, had hitherto kept very much to
herself. Her sudden and violent devotion to the newcomer
caused no little amusement in the Form. She
was promptly nicknamed "Gipsy's disciple", and subjected
to a certain amount of teasing on the score
of her attachment.</p>

<p>"You agree with every single thing Gipsy says,"
laughed Norah Bell. "I believe if she declared the
trees were pink and the houses green, you'd uphold
her!"</p>

<p>"Do you wear her portrait over your heart?" enquired
Daisy Scatcherd facetiously.</p>

<p>"It was a very bad snapshot you got of her," remarked
Ethel Newton.</p>

<p>"It certainly didn't do her justice," returned Meg,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
taking the matter quite seriously. "I'm going to have
a new camera for my birthday, then I'll try again.
But no snapshot could make Gipsy look as sweet as
she really does."</p>

<p>"Not to your love-lorn eyes!" giggled the girls.</p>

<p>"Meg's a perfect joke at present," said Ethel Newton
to Daisy Scatcherd. "She copies Gipsy slavishly, even
to doing her hair the same, and those two big bows of
ribbon don't suit her in the least, however nice they
look on Gipsy."</p>

<p>"And yet she's rather like Gipsy, just like enough
to be a kind of pale copy&mdash;an understudy, in fact."</p>

<p>"You've hit it! Understudy's the very word. She's
absolutely forming herself on Gipsy."</p>

<p>Curiously enough, Meg Gordon really bore rather a
marked physical resemblance to the object of her worship.
She was slim, and dark, and about the same
height, and though she lacked Gipsy's vivacity of
expression, a stranger might quite possibly have mistaken
the one girl for the other. It was perhaps just
as well that Gipsy had one such devoted ally, for
there were a few malcontents in the Form who were
not at all ready to accept her with enthusiasm. Maude
Helm had taken a dislike to her from the first, and
had allowed her prejudice not only to blind her to
Gipsy's good points, but to cause her to try to
influence others in her disfavour. It is rarely that
anybody succeeds in doing a public service without
making any enemies, and Gipsy was no exception to
the rule. According to Maude's code, she had violated
every tradition of school etiquette by pushing herself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
a newcomer, into a position of prominence; and that
she had conferred a real benefit upon the Lower School
by her championship went for nothing.</p>

<p>"It's sickening, the way everybody truckles to her,"
declared Maude to a few of her particular chums. "I
vote we stick out, at any rate, and don't let her have
everything her own way. We don't want the school
Americanized to suit her fancy."</p>

<p>"No; Miss Yankee will have to find out we're not
all ready to lick her boots!" grumbled Alice O'Connor.</p>

<p>"Glad she wasn't chosen President of the Guild, at
any rate," remarked Gladys Merriman. "If she puts
up for anything else I shall oppose her. There are
other people in this Form quite as capable of taking
the lead as she is, if they only got the chance."</p>

<p>"Yourself not excepted, I suppose!" snapped Mary
Parsons, who happened to overhear. "You forget
Gipsy refused the Presidency voluntarily."</p>

<p>"Clever enough to see it would pay her best!"
sneered Gladys. "She evidently knows how to get
round the Form."</p>

<p>"Gladys! How mean you are! Well, you can't do
Gipsy much harm by your nastiness, that's one comfort."</p>

<p>"It only makes me like her all the more," broke out
Joyce Adamson, who had strolled up to take Mary's
arm.</p>

<p>"All the same," said Mary to Joyce, as they walked
away, "I believe those three would do Gipsy a bad
turn if they got the chance."</p>

<p>"But could they?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Easy enough. Gipsy's anything but a favourite
with the monitresses after this Guild business, and
they'd be only too delighted to drop on her if they
found a reasonable excuse."</p>

<p>"So they would, and Gipsy's hardly what you call
a bread-and-butter Miss!"</p>

<p>"I should rather think not! She's ready for any
amount of fun. She's bound to come into collision
with Helen Roper sooner or later. I shall give her
a hint that she'd better look out."</p>

<p>Gipsy was getting along famously in the Upper
Fourth. Though some of the work was rather different
from what she had been accustomed to in her
former schools, she was a bright girl, and managed to
fill up her deficiencies with tolerable ease. In one or
two subjects she was actually ahead of her Form, and
in all practical matters she had a mine of past experience
to draw upon. She approved of her Form
mistress, Miss White, adored the Swedish drill mistress,
tolerated the German governess, and detested
the French master. For Miss Edith she was disposed
to reserve a very warm place in her heart, but she
frankly disliked Miss Poppleton.</p>

<p>"There are headmistresses and headmistresses," she
said. "Of course one expects them to stand on a pillar
above the common herd, but some of them condescend
to peep down below. Now Poppie doesn't. I'd as
soon think of going to the man in the moon, and telling
him I felt homesick or headachy or worried about
anything, as I should to her. Much she'd care! She'd
tell me not to report myself till I was sent for! Now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
at Dorcas City Miss Judkins was just a dear! We all
went and told her our woes, and she comforted us up
like a mother. We might go errands, too, if we asked
leave first, and we made Fudge on the play-room stove
about three times a week."</p>

<p>"You're always talking about Fudge!" giggled
the boarders in whom these confidences were reposed.</p>

<p>"So'd you be if you'd once tasted it, I guess. It
was real mean of Poppie not to let me buy that pan.
We used to have good times candy making when I
was out West," said Gipsy, relapsing into Americanisms
at the remembrance of past delights in the States.</p>

<p>"Wish you could make some here, Yankee Doodle!
I haven't had even a chocolate drop for three days,"
declared Lennie Chapman.</p>

<p>"Poppie never said I mightn't borrow a pan," returned
Gipsy reflectively. "It would be a pity for
you not to see Fudge made. I call it neglect of your
education. I believe it's my solemn duty to try and
teach you," and her eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>"A duty's a duty," urged Lennie with a disinterested
air.</p>

<p>"It's a cruel rule that we may only buy sweets once
a week," remarked Dilys Fenton.</p>

<p>"More honoured in the breach than in the observance,"
added Hetty Hancock.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to break any rules," said Gipsy.
"There's no law against borrowing, at least none that
I've heard of. It's a good motto to do what you want
until you're told not to. Ta ta! I'm off on a foraging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
expedition. Expect me back when you see me. I'm
going to put my powers of persuasion to the test."</p>

<p>"You mad thing! Don't get into too big a scrape;
Poppie can make herself nasty!" called Hetty.</p>

<p>"Don't worry yourself! I'll keep carefully out of
Poppie's clutches," returned Gipsy, as she banged the
door of the Juniors' sitting-room.</p>

<p>"She'll get into a row with Poppie yet, though," said
Dilys; "she's far too free and easy for this school.
Did you see how Poppie glared at her this morning in
maths.?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but Gipsy didn't mind. She takes Poppie
very lightly."</p>

<p>"She'll go too far some day," returned Dilys.</p>

<p>How Gipsy managed to wheedle the cook nobody
ever discovered, but she returned in a short time
triumphantly carrying a tray.</p>

<p>"Got all I wanted!" she announced. "A pan, and
milk, and sugar, and even a bottle of vanilla. Can't
you clear a place on the table? The thing's heavy."</p>

<p>A number of willing hands swept away books,
needlework, and other impedimenta. It was evening
recreation hour, so nearly all the Junior boarders were
collected in the room. They viewed the interesting
preparations with pleased anticipation.</p>

<p>"There!" said Gipsy, putting her burden down with
a slam. "I reckon if any of you care to learn how to
make American Fudge, now's your chance! Positively
the last opportunity! By the by, 'reckon' is one of
the words Poppie said I'd got to avoid, but it slipped
out. I'll be more careful next time."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Does Poppie know you've got these things?"
squeaked Aggie Jones, a ten-year-old from the First
Form.</p>

<p>"She's a trump if she let you!" echoed Pamela
Harvey, of the Lower Second.</p>

<p>"You kids mind your own business!" said Hetty
Hancock hastily.</p>

<p>"Poppie never said I mightn't have them, which
amounts to the same thing," replied Gipsy calmly.
"She hasn't given me a list of school rules, so I can't
break them till I know what they are, can I? There's
a law in most countries that a dog's allowed a first
bite free. Well, this is going to be my first bite. Do
you want to join this cookery demonstration, or
not?"</p>

<p>"Rather!" said Lennie Chapman, "if you'll take the
responsibility."</p>

<p>"And let us taste some of it afterwards!" added
Daisy Scatcherd.</p>

<p>"I'd never be so mean as to eat it all myself. I'll
share it round evenly to the last crumb. Now, if you
want to help, you may measure out three cupfuls of
sugar, and three-quarters of a cupful of milk. Now
this tablespoonful of butter. Yes, that's all, thanks.
Somebody pull that fender away, please; I want to
get to the fire."</p>

<p>Stolen waters are sweet, and schoolgirl nature is the
same the whole world over. The Junior boarders all
had more than a suspicion that Gipsy's cookery was
unauthorized, but who could resist the attractions of
toffee making?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope it's a sort that goes cold quickly, and won't
take till next morning to harden," said Dilys Fenton.
"Last 5th of November I think we didn't boil ours
quite long enough, and we really couldn't wait, so we
ate it soft."</p>

<p>"You boil this till it threads from the spoon, and
then you beat it with a fork till it creams," murmured
Gipsy, with her head over the pan.</p>

<p>"Let me stir!" begged Pamela Harvey.</p>

<p>"You mustn't stir it. That's the secret of good Fudge-making,
not to stir at all while it's boiling. It makes
it coarse-grained if you do."</p>

<p>"Won't it burn, though?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't out in U.S.A. But then we make it on
stoves, you see. I can't guarantee it on an open fire.
By good rights it ought to have pieces of hickory nut
in it, but it won't taste bad without."</p>

<p>"I'd call that fire fierce for ordinary toffee," commented
Lennie Chapman.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I smell something," sniffed Dilys Fenton.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's burning!"</p>

<p>"Gipsy! Stir it!"</p>

<p>"It's boiling over!"</p>

<p>"Take it off, quick!"</p>

<p>Half a dozen eager hands snatched at the pan, but
it was too late; the sugary compound rose like a volcano
and overflowed into the fire. A wail of lament
came from the disappointed girls.</p>

<p>"I knew it would!" protested Lennie.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's made an awful smell! Open the window,
somebody!" shrieked Gipsy. "If we don't mind,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Poppie'll nose it out, and come poking up. Oh!
Good gracious!"</p>

<p>Gipsy might well exclaim, for there, just behind
them, stood Miss Poppleton herself. She had been
walking along the passage, and attracted by the
smell of burning, she had opened the door quietly
to ascertain the cause. There was a moment of
awful silence. Eleven sinners felt themselves most
horribly caught.</p>

<p>"Who brought these things here?" demanded Miss
Poppleton, eyeing the tray and its paraphernalia.</p>

<p>"I did. I got them from the kitchen," answered
Gipsy. "We always made Fudge in the schoolroom
in Dorcas City," she added, with a spice of defiance in
her voice.</p>

<p>"You won't here!" returned Miss Poppleton grimly.
"Take those things back to the kitchen at once. You
will stay in from hockey to-morrow, and learn a page
of French poetry. Each of you others" (glaring at
the crestfallen circle) "will copy fifty lines of <i>Paradise
Lost</i>, and bring them to me before Thursday. If you
can't be trusted, I shall have to send one of the Seniors
to sit with you in the evenings."</p>

<p>With this awful threat she departed, having first
seen the exit of Gipsy with the tray.</p>

<p>"I knew Gipsy was bound to get into a scrape
sooner or later," groaned Dilys.</p>

<p>"And we're in too, worse luck!" wailed Daisy
Scatcherd. "Fifty lines is no joke!"</p>

<p>"It's ironical of her to choose <i>Paradise Lost</i>
when the Fudge had just boiled over!" said Hetty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
"She doesn't like Gipsy, it's easy enough to see
that."</p>

<p>"Here's Gipsy back. Well, my child, what do you
think of your 'first bite', as you call it? Poppie didn't
see your privileges! You'll have the pleasure of learning
a whole page of French poetry to improve your
mind, instead of playing hockey to-morrow!"</p>

<p>"I don't care!" said Gipsy, with an obstinate set to
her mouth. "She may give me anything she likes,
to learn. When folks are nice to me, I'll keep any
number of rules; but when they begin to bully me,
I just feel inclined to go and do something outrageous.
I'm afraid there's not much love lost between Poppie
and me."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>Gipsy takes her Fling</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">When</span> the novelty of her introduction to Briarcroft
had somewhat faded, and the excitement of the Lower
School mutiny had subsided, Gipsy began to find the
life more than a trifle dull. She had an adventurous
temperament, and her roving life had given her a
taste for constant change and variety, so the prim
regime of the English boarding school seemed to her
monotonous in the extreme. She chafed against the
confinement and the regularity of the well-ordered
arrangements.</div>

<p>"I feel as if I were shut up in a box!" she declared.
"How can you all go on every day so contentedly with
this 'prunes and prism' business? When I was at
school up-country in Australia the mistress used to
notice when we got restless, and take us for a day's
camp into the bush. The day girls would bring horses
for us boarders to use (everybody rides out there), and
off we'd go, each with our picnic basket on our saddle,
and have the very jolliest good time you could imagine.
It worked off our spirits, and we'd come back to lessons
as fresh as daisies and as meek as lambs."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"You get hockey here," objected Dilys, who generally
stood up for Briarcroft institutions.</p>

<p>"Not enough of it," sighed Gipsy. "I like hockey,
but it's nothing to a day's riding."</p>

<p>"Did your headmistress ride too?" enquired Lennie.</p>

<p>"Rather! Miss Yorke was Colonial born, and could
have sat a kangaroo, I should think! She was a
different article from Poppie, I assure you."</p>

<p>"Can't imagine Poppie controlling a fiery steed,"
giggled the girls.</p>

<p>"I should like to see you on horseback, Gipsy,"
said Hetty.</p>

<p>"I'd be only too glad to accommodate you, my dear,
if you'd provide the gee-gee. I can tell you I'm just
yearning for a canter."</p>

<p>"Nothing but a clothes horse here," remarked Dilys
facetiously.</p>

<p>"Or the colt in the meadow beyond the hockey
field," said Lennie.</p>

<p>"The colt! Of course I'd forgotten the colt!" exclaimed
Gipsy rapturously.</p>

<p>"You'd never sit that wild thing! You'd have to
ride him bareback. Even your wonderful cleverness
can't do everything, I suppose!" said Gladys sarcastically.</p>

<p>"I can ride bareback," returned Gipsy. "It's nearly
as easy as with a saddle."</p>

<p>"I'd like to see you catch him first."</p>

<p>"That's perfectly possible&mdash;he wears a halter. Do
you dare me to do it? How many chocolates will
you give me if I do?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"A dozen, and a whole boxful if you ride him round
the field."</p>

<p>"Then I'll show you a little prairie practice this
afternoon. I haven't lived in the Colonies for nothing!"</p>

<p>"Don't, Gipsy, don't! It's too dangerous!" besought
Hetty and Lennie.</p>

<p>"She won't really&mdash;it's all brag!" sneered Gladys.</p>

<p>"Is it indeed, Miss Gladys Merriman? Just wait
till this afternoon, and I'll undeceive you."</p>

<p>"I'll wait to buy the box of chocolates, though,"
sniggered Gladys.</p>

<p>None of the girls really believed that Gipsy was in
earnest, yet they sallied forth to the hockey field that
afternoon with a certain amused anticipation. The
news had been spread abroad in the Lower School,
so the Juniors had assembled ten minutes in advance
of their ordinary time on the chance of witnessing
what Hetty called "the circus-riding". The hockey
ground was divided from the meadow by a strong
wooden paling, on the farther side of which the colt,
a shaggy, ungroomed, raw-boned specimen of horse-flesh,
was feeding.</p>

<p>"It is as frisky as&mdash;well, as a colt!" said Mary Parsons.
"You'd better not try to catch that creature,
Gipsy."</p>

<p>"It'll pretty soon kick her off if she does!" said
Alice O'Connor. "Well, Gipsy? Going to turn tail
at the last minute? You'd best give in!"</p>

<p>"Rather not!" returned Gipsy. "When I'm dared
to do a thing, I do it&mdash;or have a good try, at any
rate. If I'm not galloping round the field in ten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
minutes, you may count me done. Hetty, you keep
time!" And without stopping to listen to any more
remonstrances, she climbed over the palings.</p>

<p>She had brought some bread with her, and she
walked very gently towards the colt, holding out her
bait, and making a series of chirruping sounds calculated
to win its confidence. The rough little creature
paused in its task of tearing the grass, and eyed her
doubtfully. It had been petted, however, by the boys
at the farm to which it belonged (a fact of which
Gipsy was well aware when she accepted Gladys's
challenge), and had a marked partiality for such
dainties as bread, sugar, and carrots. Though Gipsy
was a stranger, it evidently considered she was familiar
with horse language, and encouraged by her
chirrups it advanced cautiously, rolling its eyes a
little, and sniffing suspiciously. Gipsy stood still, and
without moving a muscle let it come quite near and
inspect her. She held the bread on the palm of her
left hand; her right hand was ready for action when
necessary.</p>

<p>The row of girls leaning over the palings watched
in dead silence. Summoning up its courage, the colt
stretched out its nose to take the tempting bread.
Gipsy let it get the coveted morsel well within its
lips, then seized the halter with her left hand and
the long chestnut mane with her right, and with a
sudden agile bound and scramble flung herself across
its back. It was so quickly and neatly done that the
bystanders held their breath with admiration. Gipsy's
horsemanship was evidently no idle boast, if she could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
perform so difficult a feat of gymnastics with such
comparative ease. Meantime the colt, astonished and
enraged at finding a burden on its back, was trying
buck-jumping, and Gipsy had to cling to mane and
halter to keep her seat. At this critical moment the
Seniors and the mistresses arrived on the scene.
Miss Poppleton's amazement and horror at finding
one of her pupils mounted on the back of an unbroken
colt were almost too great for words.</p>

<p>"Stop her! Stop her!" she gasped wildly. "Oh,
for pity's sake, somebody stop her!"</p>

<p>But as it was certainly in nobody's power to stop
her, Gipsy had to take the consequences of her own
foolhardy act. The colt, after an amount of kicking
and plunging, stood for an instant stockstill, then,
rolling its eyes, set off at a furious gallop round the
meadow. That Gipsy managed to stick on to its back
even she herself afterwards confessed was almost a
miracle, but she kept her seat somehow. Up and
down the field fled her steed in furious career, till,
tired of galloping, it changed its tactics and stood
still and kicked, when Gipsy seized the opportunity
of sliding to the ground. She just escaped its hoofs
as, relieved of her weight, it scampered off to the
farthest limit of the boundary fence. Very dishevelled
and rather bruised and shaky, she picked herself up
from the muddy spot where she had fallen, and limped
back to the palings. The girls cheered. They couldn't
help themselves, even though Miss Poppleton was
present.</p>

<p>"She's as good as a cowboy!" exclaimed Lennie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Or a circus rider!" added Hetty proudly.</p>

<p>"Well done, Gipsy!"</p>

<p>"Bravo!"</p>

<p>Miss Poppleton, however, did not share the popular
enthusiasm, and received her adventurous pupil with
a scolding instead of congratulations.</p>

<p>"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Gipsy
Latimer," she said sternly. "It's a mercy you were
not killed. Understand once for all that I forbid
such mad proceedings. If you have hurt your leg
you had better go indoors. The sooner you learn that
these are not Briarcroft ways, the better. This is a
school for young ladies, not young hoydens!"</p>

<p>Slightly abashed, Gipsy beat a retreat to the house,
where Miss Edith, who had been an agitated spectator
from the linen-room window, bathed the wounded leg,
put arnica on the bruises, and comforted the sufferer,
while she proffered good advice.</p>

<p>"It was very naughty of you, you know, Gipsy
dear!" she said in her kind-hearted, deprecating
manner. "I don't know anything about riding, but
it looked most dangerous, and of course, if Miss
Poppleton said it was wrong, it was wrong. My
sister is always right. Please remember that. Why,
child, you're all trembling! I'll make you a cup of
Bovril, and you must lie down on your bed for an
hour. And promise me faithfully you'll never do such
a foolish, silly, mad thing again! We want to hand
you over to your father in good health when he comes
to fetch you, and he'd blame us if you were hurt."</p>

<p>"He knows me only too well," twinkled Gipsy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
"But there&mdash;I'll promise anything you like, dear
Miss Edith! Yes, the bruises feel better now, and
the Bovril would be delicious. And you're a darling!
Let me give you one hug, and I'll lie down like a
monument of patience, though I don't feel the least
scrap ill."</p>

<p>While the Seniors, with whom Gipsy was out of
favour, viewed her escapade with lofty contempt as
a madcap proceeding, the Juniors regarded her as an
even greater heroine than before. Gladys Merriman
redeemed her promise, and brought the box of chocolates
she had offered, and Gipsy with strictest impartiality
handed them round the Form till they were
finished.</p>

<p>Gipsy had certainly established her record for horse-breaking,
and though, according to Miss Poppleton, it
was scarcely a lady-like accomplishment, there was
hardly anyone in the Lower School who did not admire
her prowess.</p>

<p>"You're like the girl in the cinematograph who
tracks the villain to his mountain retreat, or finds the
hero, bound with cords, lying in the brushwood, and
then rides off post-haste to inform the sheriff. She
always catches a wild-looking horse, and gallops full
speed!" laughed Dilys.</p>

<p>"I wish we'd a cinema camera!" sighed Hetty. "We
might have taken some gorgeous records this afternoon
for the Photographic Society. No one even got
a snapshot."</p>

<p>"Your own faults, not mine! You should have
brought your cameras!" returned Gipsy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"We never thought you'd really do it."</p>

<p>"Is that so? Well, when I allow to do any special
thing, I guess I admire to see it through!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you Yankee!" roared the others.</p>

<p>Though the girls laughed at her Americanisms and
Colonial ways, and often teased her about them, Gipsy
continued as great a favourite as ever, she took all
the banter so good-temperedly, and returned it so
smartly. There was always a delightful uncertainty
also as to what she would do next, and the prospect of
an exciting interlude by "Yankee Doodle", as she was
nicknamed, was felt decidedly to relieve the monotony
of the ordinary Briarcroft atmosphere. Not that
Gipsy really ever meant to behave badly; but, accustomed
as she was to the free-and-easy conduct of her
up-country Colonial schools, she found it almost impossible
to realize that what would have been tolerated
there with a smile was in her new surroundings
counted a heinous crime. The silence rules and the
orderly march in step from classroom to lecture hall
filled her with dismay. She appeared to expect to be
allowed to tear about the passages, talking at top
speed, even in school hours, and many were the admonitions
she incurred from indignant monitresses.</p>

<p>"A fine model you are for the Lower School!" said
Doreen Tristram sarcastically one day. "Can't even
walk decently in line, and prance about for all the
world like a monkey tied to a barrel piano!"</p>

<p>Doreen had taken the defection of the Juniors much
to heart, and could not forgive the leader of the opposition.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thanks! I wasn't aware my movements were so
original!" retorted Gipsy. "There's method in my
madness this time, though. I was trying to dodge
Miss White, and dash upstairs to get my <i>Hamlet</i>.
I've forgotten the wretched thing, and if I go to class
without a book, Poppie&mdash;h'm! I mean Miss Poppleton"
(as Doreen's eyebrows went up)&mdash;"will want to
know the reason why."</p>

<p>"I expect she will," returned Doreen dryly. "And
serve you right too, for forgetting! No, I shall not
allow you to go and fetch it. I'm here to keep order,
not to help you out of scrapes."</p>

<p>The Upper Fourth, under Doreen's superintendence,
had just filed from its own classroom to attend a
Shakespeare lecture by the Principal. The girls were
a few minutes early, and in consequence were drawn
up like a small regiment in the corridor to wait until
a previous class was over and they could enter the
lecture hall. Waiting is often dull work, and Gipsy
had considered herself a public benefactor in seeking
to enliven the tedium of her form mates. Doreen's
notions on the subject of discipline did not appeal to
her.</p>

<p>"But I can't go to the Shakespeare lesson without
my <i>Hamlet</i>," she remonstrated. "Suppose I'm asked
to read?"</p>

<p>"You should have thought of that before!" snapped
Doreen. "Be quiet, Gipsy Latimer; if you speak another
word I shall report you!"</p>

<p>Gipsy refrained from further unavailing speech, but
her active brain was by no means silenced. I do not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
think anybody but herself would have dreamed of
doing what followed. The outer door of the corridor
was standing open, and when the monitress's back
was for the moment turned, Gipsy slipped out into
the playground. On the opposite side of the quadrangle
stood the open window of her classroom, ten
feet or so above the ground. The wall of that part of
the house was thickly covered with ivy, and in less
time than it takes to tell it she was scrambling up
with as much agility as the monkey to which Doreen
had unfeelingly compared her. A few girls who happened
to be standing near the door and witnessed
her achievement gasped audibly, but I verily believe
Gipsy would have been back before she was missed,
had not Maude Helm officiously chirped out:</p>

<p>"Oh, I say! Look at Yankee Doodle!"</p>

<p>Naturally the monitress did look, and fled into
the courtyard in pursuit of the runaway. Her outraged
face, upturned from below, greeted Gipsy as
that irrepressible damsel reappeared at the window
waving her <i>Hamlet</i> in triumph.</p>

<p>"Gipsy Latimer, go back down the stairs!" commanded
Doreen.</p>

<p>"No, thanks! It's shorter this way, and saves time,"
returned Gipsy, dropping her book first, then swinging
herself out of the window. She came down the ivy
quite easily, picked up her <i>Hamlet</i>, smoothed its
cover, which had suffered in the fall, and flitted back
to her place in the corridor, just as the lecture room
door opened to let out the Third Form and admit the
Upper Fourth. Doreen followed grimly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"You needn't think you're going to play these
tricks with impunity," she said. "You'll report yourself
to-morrow at the monitresses' meeting at four
o'clock. We'll see what the head of the school has to
say to you!"</p>

<p>"Delighted, I'm sure! I've got my <i>Hamlet</i>, anyhow,"
chuckled naughty Gipsy, as she disappeared
into the lecture hall.</p>

<p>On this occasion I am afraid she was not altogether
innocent of cause of offence, and had taken a distinct
pleasure in defying Doreen. Perhaps she thought, on
maturer consideration, that she had gone a trifle too
far, for she turned up at the monitresses' meeting with
a countenance sobered down to the requirements of so
solemn a convocation.</p>

<p>"Gipsy Latimer, you are here to report yourself for
insubordination," began Helen Roper with dignity.
"Do you realize that monitresses are officers in this
school, and that their authority is only second to that
of the mistresses?"</p>

<p>Gipsy took a clean handkerchief from her pocket,
and, unfolding it ostentatiously, blinked hard.</p>

<p>"I realize it now," she answered, with a something
in her voice that might have been either
laughter or tears; "I'm afraid I was very ignorant
before."</p>

<p>Helen glared at her suspiciously. Was that a
twinkle in the dark eyes? But no; Gipsy was looking
grave in the extreme.</p>

<p>"The monitresses must be obeyed," continued the
head of the school. "Every girl at Briarcroft knows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
that, and anyone who deliberately disobeys incurs the
penalty of being reported to Miss Poppleton."</p>

<p>The corners of Gipsy's mouth were drooping; her
face had assumed an expression of abject penitence.</p>

<p>"Please don't do that to me!" she pleaded humbly.
"Remember how badly I've been brought up! If I'd
been at Briarcroft all the time, instead of other schools,
and had had the advantage of the monitresses, I might
have been different."</p>

<p>"I expect you would," said Helen freezingly. "And
you'll please to remember that now you're here, you'll
have to conform to our standards."</p>

<p>"I know I'm a heathen. I'll be only too grateful
to be taught better," murmured the subdued voice that
was so strangely unlike Gipsy's usual sprightly tones.</p>

<p>Lena Morris turned away to hide a smile. She was
possessed of a strong sense of humour, and moreover
had a sneaking liking for Gipsy.</p>

<p>"Mind you do as you're told next time, then,"
commanded Helen. "I'll excuse you this once, but if
it happens again, I warn you that I shall send you
straight to Miss Poppleton. You may think yourself
very lucky to be let off so easily. You can go now."</p>

<p>Gipsy's big brown eyes looked like two wells absolutely
overflowing with gratitude and humility.</p>

<p>"Thanks so very immensely much! It's far more
than I deserve!" she sighed, and, flaunting the clean
handkerchief, beat a hasty retreat.</p>

<p>The monitresses would have been edified if they
could have seen the war dance she executed in the
passage as soon as the door was shut.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Couldn't have kept my face a moment longer!"
she choked to one or two friends who were waiting
for her. "Oh, you should have seen me as
the penitent! I think I did the thing rather
neatly."</p>

<p>"You mad hatter! I wonder Helen didn't see you
were shamming," said Hetty.</p>

<p>"No, no! She's been improving my mind and showing
me the path I ought to walk in. How would you
like me if I turned out a first-class prig?"</p>

<p>"It couldn't be done. Come along, you wild gipsy
thing! Do you want the monitresses to come out and
catch you? You'll get into a really big scrape some
day if you're not careful."</p>

<p>"Some people are born wise and proper, and some
are born otherwise. I'm one of the otherwise! It's
my misfortune, not my fault," laughed Gipsy, as
Lennie and Hetty dragged her forcibly away.</p>

<p>Gipsy's wild spirits were undoubtedly liable to lead
her beyond the bounds of propriety, and both mistresses
and monitresses were inclined, justly or unjustly,
to suspect that she was at the bottom of any
mischief that cropped up in the school. One incident,
though shrouded in mystery, was generally laid by
Miss Poppleton as a sin to her charge. In the upper
corridor, not very far from Gipsy's dormitory, hung a
long chain which sounded a fire bell. The boarders
at Briarcroft were instructed in fire drill, though a
night summons was generally only given in summertime,
as Miss Poppleton was afraid of the girls
catching cold. Gipsy had read the printed card of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
"Directions in case of Fire", and had examined the
chute with intense interest.</p>

<p>"I'd just love to go sliding down it out of our bedroom
window," she exclaimed. "It would be almost
as much fun as toboganning."</p>

<p>"Rather freezing work on these sharp nights. There
was ice on the puddles this morning," said Dilys. "No
fire-drill practice for me, thank you! I prefer to stop
snug in bed."</p>

<p>"You've no spirit of adventure in you," returned
Gipsy.</p>

<p>"I've got sound common sense instead, and that's
what you don't possess, Yankee Doodle!"</p>

<p>"All the same, that summons is going to come off,
by hook or by crook!" said Gipsy to herself. "It
would be a kindness to the school to give it a chance
to see whether it's prepared for emergencies. Gipsy
Latimer, I guess you'll have to be the philanthropist!
But you've no need to flaunt your noble deed. 'Do
good by stealth, and blush to find it fame', in fact."</p>

<p>If Gipsy, before she went to bed that night, contrived
to tie a long piece of string to the bell chain in
the passage, and to secure the other end to her bedpost,
she did not blazon the fact abroad, and the string was
so neatly laid against the edges of skirting board and
under mats that nobody happened to notice it. At
3 a.m., when the whole of Briarcroft was wrapped in
deepest slumbers, there suddenly came the great <i>clang-clang</i>
of the fire bell, resounding and echoing through
the quiet house. Everybody woke in a hurry, and the
head of each dormitory at once switched on the electric<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
light and assumed command. The well-trained girls
dipped their towels in water and put them over their
mouths, threw the red blankets from their beds round
their shoulders, and lined up along the corridor. Miss
Lindsay was already there, and gave the command to
march, and away trooped the boarders downstairs
and out of the front door on to the lawn, where they
ranged themselves to be counted. The light streaming
through the front door revealed a strange sight&mdash;all
the girls in night gear, with their scarlet blankets
trailing on the ground. The juveniles were clasping
dolls and other treasures, and some of the others had
caught up big sponges in their confusion. The whole
exit had only taken about a hundred seconds from
the sounding of the bell, and if Gipsy was last, and
clutched a roll of string in her hand, nobody remarked
the circumstance.</p>

<p>There followed a hurried enquiry among the mistresses
as to the whereabouts of the fire, and the discovery
that no fire existed. Miss Poppleton hastily
gave the order to return, and the boarders trooped
back shivering to the dormitories, not a little disconcerted
to have been disturbed for nothing on a chilly
night in November. The Principal made every enquiry
next day as to the source of the alarm, but she
could discover nothing. Dilys Fenton was able to
assure her that when she had switched on the light in
No. 3 Dormitory Gipsy Latimer had been asleep, and
she had been obliged to shake her violently to awaken
her, so it was quite impossible that Gipsy could be
responsible for the practical joke. The occurrence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
made a great excitement among the boarders. For
days they talked of scarcely anything else.</p>

<p>"It was over too soon, and they didn't use the
chute after all," said Gipsy disconsolately.</p>

<p>"Gipsy! you never&mdash;you couldn't&mdash; Oh, surely&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>But Gipsy's brown eyes looked such absolute mirrors
of innocence that even Hetty's suspicions were laid to
rest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>Daisy Forgets</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Though</span> Gipsy was accustomed to try to enjoy herself
in any place where circumstances chanced to fling
her, and though she had contrived to settle down
fairly happily at Briarcroft, she nevertheless thought
often of her father, far away on the opposite side of
the Equator. He must long ago have arrived at the
Cape, and it was high time that she received news
from him, telling her of his whereabouts. Every
morning she looked out anxiously for the post, but
day after day brought the same disappointment. She
was the only boarder who had no letters, and she
often felt her isolated position keenly when she saw
her schoolmates tearing open their welcome budgets.
It would be nice, she thought, to have a mother and
brothers and sisters to write to her, and a home to
go to in the holidays. In her roving life she could
not remember a real home; a log hut for a few weeks
in a mining camp had been the nearest approach
to it.</div>

<p>"But I've Dad, and he's better than a whole family;
and it's fun to go about the world with him, though
I do live mostly at hotels when I'm not at school,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
she said to herself. "I'm not going to worry my
head. Dad will send me a letter as soon as he possibly
can, I know. He's not in the least likely to
forget me."</p>

<p>So she tried to comfort herself, but every day
she looked out wistfully for the postman&mdash;how wistfully
nobody but Miss Edith ever noticed. It was
growing towards the end of November, and already
the boarders were beginning to talk of the holidays.
The evening recreation time was devoted to the making
of Christmas presents; even the little girls were busy
embroidering traycloths and constructing pincushions.
Gipsy began to work a pair of slippers for her father,
a rather lengthy proceeding, for she was not clever at
needlecraft, and was apt to pull her wool too tightly,
having to unpick her stitches in consequence. There
was no particular hurry in her case, though, for it
was impossible for her to dispatch the parcel in time
for Christmas when she did not know where to
address it. If there was a forlorn look in the brown
eyes sometimes when others talked about home, they
twinkled again so readily that her schoolmates never
realized she could feel lonely, and a stranger in a
strange land. To them she appeared the very epitome
of fun and happy-go-lucky carelessness, and they
would have been surprised indeed if they had known
what a very sore heart she carried occasionally under
her outward assumption of jollity.</p>

<p>Daisy Scatcherd's birthday fell on the last day of
November. Daisy, though she merited her nickname
of "Scatterbrains", was rather a favourite among the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
boarders, so she came off very well indeed in the
matter of presents. Her home people had also remembered
her, and many interesting parcels arrived
for her during the course of the morning. Between
four and half-past, in the afternoon, she was taking
a run round the garden in company with a few friends,
when she spied the postman walking briskly up the
drive.</p>

<p>"I expect he's got something more for me," she exclaimed,
and dived under the laurels to take a short
cut to the drive and intercept him.</p>

<p>"Give me the letters, please! It's my birthday!"
she said breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Only three this afternoon, missy! Don't know
whether any of 'em's for you or not," said the man,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Let me see! Yes! yes! I'll take them, please.
It's all right."</p>

<p>Not sorry to save the extra walk to the house, the
postman departed. He was late, and had a long
round before he could return home. Daisy was
looking eagerly at the letters. One, a thin foreign
envelope, was addressed to Miss Gipsy Latimer, and
that she thrust hastily into her coat pocket; the other
two were for herself. They both contained postal
orders, which elevated her to such heights of satisfaction
that she never gave a thought to the letter
she had stuffed in her pocket: indeed, in her excitement
she had put it away so automatically that the
incident faded from her memory almost as soon as
it happened. She rushed into the house in a state of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
great exultation, to ask Miss Edith to take charge of
her orders, and put them away safely.</p>

<p>"A whole pound! Isn't it lovely? I shall buy a
new camera, or perhaps a bookcase like Hetty Hancock's;
or I want a bracelet watch most fearfully
badly, and I expect I'll get some more money at
Christmas that I could put to it. What would you
advise, Miss Edith?" she chattered.</p>

<p>"Wait till you go home and consult your mother,"
said Miss Edith. "What a cold you've got, child!
You oughtn't to have been running about the garden.
And this coat is much too thin. You must wear your
thick one now. Put this away in your wardrobe, to
take home at Christmas."</p>

<p>"Mother said I needn't take my autumn clothes
back with me," objected Daisy. "It only crams up
my boxes. She said they might as well be left
here."</p>

<p>"Very well. I'll put it away in my big cupboard
until the spring. Here are some cough lozenges, and
I shall rub your chest to-night with camphorated oil.
Go and sit by the fire, and mind you don't get into
draughts."</p>

<p>"I've got all my birthday letters to answer," replied
Daisy, as she tripped gaily away. "I don't particularly
want to go out again."</p>

<p>Miss Edith folded the coat neatly, placed a packet
of camphor balls with it to keep away moths, and
laid it with a pile of similar garments inside a large
cupboard in the linen room. It never struck her to
look in the pockets, so the letter so longed for and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
expected lay upstairs in the dark, and Gipsy waited
and hoped, and hoped and waited, all in vain.</p>

<p>To forget her troubles she threw herself with enthusiasm
into the working of the Dramatic Section of
the Lower School Guild. The Juniors intended to act
<i>The Sleeping Beauty</i>, and she had been chosen as
the wicked fairy, a part which she rehearsed with
much spirit. She was unwearied in her efforts at
arranging costumes, constructing scenery, and coaching
her fellow performers in their speeches. She soon
had the whole play by heart, and could act prompter
without the help of the book&mdash;a decided convenience
to those whose memories were liable to fail them at
critical moments.</p>

<p>Though the Guild comprised a number of separate
societies, it lacked one feature which Gipsy considered
it certainly ought to possess. Briarcroft had no school
magazine, and not even among the Seniors had one
ever been suggested.</p>

<p>"Yet it's really a most necessary thing," urged
Gipsy. "How else can one give notice of coming
events, and reports of what has taken place? It's
such fun, too! Why shouldn't we steal a march on
the Upper School and start one of our own?"</p>

<p>"There's the expense, my child, for one thing,"
replied Mary Parsons, who was treasurer of the United
Guild. "The subscriptions don't go very far when
we want to buy so many things with them. I'm sure
they wouldn't run to printing."</p>

<p>"I never intended having it printed. I know that
would be beyond us."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps we could have it typed," suggested Fiona
Campbell, whose father was a journalist. "Dad
always sends his articles to a typing office, and it
looks just as good as printing when it's done."</p>

<p>"I don't think the Guild could afford even that,"
said Mary. "The costumes for the play will about
clear out the funds for this term, and next term, you
know, we voted to buy a developing machine."</p>

<p>"It was mean of the Seniors to stick to all the
properties of the other Guilds! They might have
given us something," put in Norah Bell.</p>

<p>"Trust them! They wouldn't part with so much
as a twopenny music sheet!" said Gipsy. "But about
the Magazine; it needn't cost us anything. My idea
was to ask Miss White to lend us the duplicator, and
we'd make a copy for each Form. They could be
lent round and round. If we liked we might put in
a few illustrations. You're good at drawing, Fiona."</p>

<p>"That certainly sounds more simple," said Dilys.
"And the Mag. would be ripping fun. We'd have
articles and poetry and stories and reviews and all
sorts of things."</p>

<p>"Would it be a monthly?" enquired Hetty.</p>

<p>"I should say about twice a term would be enough,"
said Gipsy. "It would be difficult to get contributions
if you had it too often."</p>

<p>"We couldn't duplicate the illustrations," objected
Fiona, whose mind was already turned to things
artistic.</p>

<p>"No; each Form would have to provide its own
pictures for its own copy. That would make it all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the more interesting. There'd be no two quite
alike."</p>

<p>"And we could even have advertisements, and a
kind of Exchange and Mart!" exclaimed Dilys, who
was immensely taken with the idea. "It would just
suit the First and Second; they're always trading
white mice or silkworms with one another."</p>

<p>"We'll add a Beauty Bureau, with hints about the
complexion, if you like," suggested Gipsy demurely.</p>

<p>The others laughed, for Dilys was rather vain of
her appearance, and kept many bottles of toilet requisites
upon her portion of the dressing-table.</p>

<p>"Best call a general meeting of the Guild; then we
can propose the thing, and have it carried through in
proper order," said Hetty. "I believe it will catch
on. Gipsy, you write out some notices and pin them
up in the classrooms."</p>

<div class='center'>
"A GENERAL MEETING<br />
<br />

<br />
Will be held on <span class="smcap">Thursday</span> at 4 p.m. in the<br />

</div>

<p>So ran the Secretary's notice, and the girls who read
it were only too eager to respond to the invitation.
They felt that Gipsy stirred things up at Briarcroft,
and were ready to listen to anything fresh she might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
have to suggest. As Hetty had expected, the idea
was received with enthusiasm, and when Gipsy propounded
her scheme in detail, everybody cordially
agreed, and the motion was carried unanimously.</p>

<p>"There's one principal matter to be settled," said
Dilys, who, as President, occupied the post of chairman.
"We've got to choose an editor."</p>

<p>"Then I beg to propose Gipsy Latimer," said Meg
Gordon, rising hastily.</p>

<p>"And I beg to second the proposal," said Hetty
Hancock.</p>

<p>"Gipsy! Yes, Gipsy!" exclaimed the girls, and a
forest of hands went up.</p>

<p>"You'll have to take it, Gipsy," urged Hetty. "You're
the most suitable of anybody. It's a new thing in the
school, so it's best managed by a new girl. We should
none of us understand how to do it. Besides, you
suggested it. The whole plan of it is yours."</p>

<p>"Right-o, if you think I'm 'the man for the job',"
agreed Gipsy.</p>

<p>Though she had not canvassed for the post, Gipsy
was delighted to get the editorship. Running a magazine
was work that exactly suited her. She was sure
she could make it a success, and she looked forward
with immense satisfaction to issuing her first number.
A name had yet to be chosen, and after much debate
it was decided to call the new venture the <i>Briarcroft
Juniors' Journal</i>.</p>

<p>"That'll quite cut the Seniors out of it," said Meg
Gordon. "We don't want them to get any of the
credit."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"And 'Juniors' Journal' has a nice juicy kind of
sound," said Daisy Scatcherd.</p>

<p>"A juicy journal would be a new departure&mdash;it
suggests oily words and honeyed speeches!" laughed
Hetty.</p>

<p>By general vote, the first number was to be issued
a week before the end of the term, so Gipsy had to
set to work in earnest in her capacity of editress, inviting
contributions from likely members, and settling
the various departments of her magazine. She intended
to conduct it on the lines of a real publication,
and to keep separate pages for Sports and Pastimes,
Reviews of Books, Nature Notes, How to Make
Things, Handy Recipes, Puzzles, Competitions, and
Letters from Correspondents, as well as matter of a
more original literary character. It was rather a big
order, but Gipsy's ambitions soared high; she felt it
was a chance for the Lower School to shine, and she
spared no trouble to make her scheme a success.</p>

<p>There was very little time for all this, but she
worked systematically, apportioning the departments
among different girls, and making them promise to
write certain things. Joyce Adamson, who was "great"
on hockey, was told off for "Sports and Pastimes";
Ethel Newton, a day girl, who lived a few miles away
quite in the heart of the country, undertook the
"Nature Notes"; Meg Gordon's fertile brain could
be trusted to invent puzzles and competitions; neat-fingered
Norah Bell contributed an article on "How
to make Paper Boxes"; and Gipsy herself undertook
the "Library Shelf" and "Answers to Correspondents".<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Fiona Campbell provided some dainty illustrations,
and her example was emulated by members of other
Forms, who were also invited to submit articles, stories,
nature notes, and puzzles. Gipsy, with the oligarchy
of the Seniors fresh in her memory as a warning, did
not wish the Upper Fourth to monopolize the Magazine
by any means, and the younger girls were
strongly urged to try their 'prentice hands at the art
of composition. She herself was busy with the opening
chapter of a serial, in which she intended to set
forth all her adventures in the Colonies, embroidered
by the aid of her imagination. Fortunately Miss
White was kind, and, sympathizing with the idea of
a magazine, allowed the duplicator to be used in its
production, so that Gipsy was able to strike off six
copies, for the First, Second, Lower Third, Upper
Third, Lower Fourth, and Upper Fourth respectively.
Each Form undertook to produce its own cover, the
younger children being helped by the drawing mistress,
who was much interested, and allowed a special
afternoon to be devoted to the purpose. The designs
were painted on brown paper, and varied from sprays
of flowers to conventional patterns, according to the
taste of the Form, though each bore in large letters the
same inscription: <i>Briarcroft Juniors' Journal</i>.</p>

<p>It was a proud day for Gipsy when she completed her
arrangements, and all the six copies were ready in their
artistic covers. The contributors had really done their
best in the brief time at their disposal. There were
two or three short stories, an article on pet dogs, some
recipes for sweets and toffee, including Gipsy's favourite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
American Fudge, and quite a long page of nature
notes, the latter being contributed mostly by the day
girls. Gipsy had not had time to write any book
reviews, but she had enjoyed herself over the answers
to correspondents. She had posted up a notice inviting
letters when first the scheme for the Magazine
was accepted, and quite a budget had been delivered
at the "editorial office"&mdash;otherwise her school desk.
Some were couched in rather a facetious vein, but she
answered them as if they were intended to be serious,
sometimes with a comic result. A correspondent who
signed herself "Honeysuckle" had enquired: "Can
you tell me how to stop my feet from growing any
bigger? I take fives in shoes and I am only eleven."
To which Gipsy replied: "You are evidently eating
too much, Honeysuckle! Limit your diet to water
and crusts, and abstain from sweets, cakes, and toffee
in any form. You will then probably stop growing
at all in any direction, either up or down."</p>

<p>Gertie Butler, of the Lower Third, had blossomed
into poetry, and had composed an "Ode to the Magazine",
the opening lines of which ran:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Hail, literary gem of Briarcroft Hall!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Thou com'st to be a blessing to us all".</span><br />
</div>

<p>The exchange column was voted "ripping", and
resulted in the transfer of several families of white
mice, some foreign stamps, a variety of picture post-cards,
and other treasures. The first instalment of
Gipsy's serial, "The Girl Pioneer of Wild Cat Creek",
was so thrillingly exciting that its readers could hardly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
wait for the second chapter, and pressed the authoress
for details of "what was coming next"; but as Gipsy
had not made up any more, they were obliged to curb
their impatience. Altogether the Magazine was a
brilliant success; and if it lacked anything in composition
and grammar, it made that up in other ways.
Miss Poppleton, who examined a copy, expressed her
entire approval, and the teachers greatly encouraged
the girls to persevere and continue this new branch of
the Guild. The Seniors affected to ignore the whole
affair.</p>

<p>"But that's just put on," said Hetty Hancock.
"They know all about it. I saw Helen Roper and
Doreen Tristram sneak into our classroom yesterday
when no one was there, at dinner-time. The Mag. was
lying on Miss White's desk, and they took it up and
began to read it. They simply shrieked with laughing."</p>

<p>"What cheek! Let them write one of their own
then!" exclaimed the indignant editress. "I'll undertake
to say it wouldn't be half as interesting as ours!"</p>

<p>"Not one ten-millionth part as nice. Ours is just
too scrumptiously ripping!" agreed Hetty.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>Gipsy grows Anxious</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Gipsy</span> spent the Christmas holidays at Briarcroft.
Miss Poppleton went away to Switzerland, to refresh
her tired mind with the winter sports; but Miss Edith
stayed behind, to count linen, and superintend workmen
who were making some alterations in the bathrooms.
She and Gipsy managed to enjoy themselves
in a quiet manner, but the latter hailed the return of
her schoolfellows with considerable relief. The house
seemed so big and silent and lonely without its usual
lively crew of boarders, and the dormitory with its
empty beds oppressed her. Miss Poppleton came back
more brisk and bustling than ever, and was at once
immersed in the business of interviewing parents and
rearranging school affairs, and in the thousand and one
cares that always occupied her at the beginning of
term.</div>

<p>When about ten days had gone by, and Briarcroft
had settled down into its ordinary routine, she sent
a message to Gipsy to report herself in the study.
Gipsy obeyed with a feeling of considerable apprehension.
Miss Poppleton's manner towards her, never
very gracious, had been markedly cold since the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Christmas holidays. For some reason she was evidently
much out of favour. She tapped more deferentially
at the study door, and entered less confidently
than she had done on the morning after her arrival.
A term at Briarcroft had taught her many lessons.
The Principal was seated at her desk, studying an
account book, and to judge from the jerking movements
of her mouth, she was in a state of mind quite
the reverse of amiable.</p>

<p>"Gipsy Latimer," she began uncompromisingly,
"I've sent for you to enquire if you've heard anything
at all from your father?"</p>

<p>Gipsy shook her head silently. It was such a sore
subject that she could hardly bear to speak about it.</p>

<p>"It's a most extraordinary thing!" commented Miss
Poppleton. "Since the day he left you here, he has
never written a line either to me or to you. I don't
like the look of it at all. Did he tell you where he
was going?"</p>

<p>"Back to Cape Town," replied Gipsy briefly.</p>

<p>"Did he leave you any address?"</p>

<p>"No; he said he would be going up-country into
a very wild place, but he would write when he got to
the Cape."</p>

<p>"Has he any friends at Cape Town who would
know of his whereabouts?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of."</p>

<p>The barometer of Miss Poppleton's face seemed to
fall still lower.</p>

<p>"This won't do at all!" she said, frowning. "When
your father brought you, he paid for you up to Christmas,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
but no more. Now, the rule of this school is that
fees must be paid in advance at the beginning of each
term. I don't make an exception for anybody. Where
are your fees for this term, I should like to know?&mdash;to
say nothing of the holidays you spent here!"</p>

<p>It was such an utterly unanswerable question that
Gipsy did not attempt a reply.</p>

<p>"I had a girl left on my hands like this once before,"
continued Miss Poppleton, "and I said then it should
never happen again. Have you any relations in
England?"</p>

<p>"Not one!"</p>

<p>"Or friends who could take charge of you?"</p>

<p>"I know absolutely nobody in England."</p>

<p>"Who are your relations, then? Surely you must
have some in some portion of the globe?"</p>

<p>"Not any near ones. We have some cousins in
New Zealand, at a farm right up in the bush."</p>

<p>"Where did your father come from? Hadn't your
mother any relations?"</p>

<p>"Father was born in New Zealand, but his grandfather
came out from England. Mother was an
American, from Texas, I believe. Her mother was
Spanish. I never heard about her relations. She
died when I was a baby, and we've always been
travelling about ever since I can remember."</p>

<p>"Humph! That doesn't look well. Had your
father no permanent address, then, where letters
would always be forwarded to him?"</p>

<p>"I never heard him say so."</p>

<p>Gipsy stood with her little brown hands pressed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
hard together, and her mouth set tightly while she
answered this unwelcome catechism. Miss Poppleton
might have pitied the sad look in the dark eyes, but
she went on bluntly:</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's only too evident he wants to get
rid of the burden of your education. We've got to
trace him somehow. It's all very fine for him to
leave you here and desert you!"</p>

<p>Gipsy's face turned crimson, and the big sob that
had been gathering in her throat nearly choked her
for a moment.</p>

<p>"Father would never desert me!" she gasped at last.
"He promised faithfully he'd come back and fetch me.
Oh! you don't know Dad, to say that. I'm afraid
something's happened to him&mdash;out there!"</p>

<p>She did not tell Miss Poppleton how she had hoped
against hope, and lain awake at night wondering, and
searching her mind for any possible solution of his
silence, but she looked such a forlorn little figure that
in spite of herself the Principal slightly relented.</p>

<p>"Well, Gipsy," she said more kindly, "I'm afraid it
looks a bad business. I'm sure you understand that
it would be impossible for me to keep on my school if
pupils did not pay their fees. I can't afford to be
kept waiting. In your case, however, we'll let matters
stand for awhile, and see if we hear from your father.
In the meantime I might write to your cousins in New
Zealand. It will take three months, though, before I
can get a letter back."</p>

<p>"More," sighed Gipsy. "They only go down to the
town once a month for letters, and not then if the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
river's in flood. They live in such a wild place&mdash;right
up in the bush."</p>

<p>"At any rate they're your relations, and ought to
be responsible for you," snapped Miss Poppleton. "If
the worst comes to the worst, I could send you out
to them through the Emigration Society. It's a very
awkward position to be placed in&mdash;very awkward
indeed. You're absolutely sure you know of nobody,
either in England or at the Cape, who could give information
about your father?"</p>

<p>"No one at all. I didn't know anything about
Dad's business. I was at school, and he used just
to come and fetch me for the holidays," confessed
Gipsy sadly.</p>

<p>Miss Poppleton shut her account book with an
annoyed slam.</p>

<p>"Well, there's no further help for it at present.
We must see what turns up. Of course, I can't pretend
to keep you here indefinitely. Give me the
address of your cousins in New Zealand, and I will
write to them to-day. That seems the best we can
do. The whole thing is most unfortunate."</p>

<p>Gipsy dictated the address as steadily as she could,
then taking advantage of Miss Poppleton's brief "That
will do; you may go now!" she fled to the most remote
corner of her dormitory and sobbed her heart out.
There she was found later on by Miss Edith, who
came to put away clean clothes. Poor Miss Edith
was generally torn in two between strict loyalty to
her sister and the promptings of her own kind heart.
She knew the cause of Gipsy's trouble well enough.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
She sat down beside the forlorn child, and comforted
her as best she could.</p>

<p>"I wish Dad would write! Oh, he can't have forgotten
me! I wish I'd anybody to go to; I haven't a
soul nearer than New Zealand!" wailed Gipsy.</p>

<p>"You mustn't make yourself so miserable, Gipsy
dear!" said Miss Edith nervously. "I'm sure Miss
Poppleton will keep you here for a while, and perhaps
your father will write after all. My sister will
do everything that's right&mdash;she always does. Oh,
don't sob so, child! She'll see that you're taken care
of. Do try to cheer up, that's a dear! You must
trust Miss Poppleton, Gipsy. There, there! You'll
feel better now you've had a good cry. Wash your
face in cold water, and take a run round the garden.
It's a good thing it's Saturday!"</p>

<p>Gipsy didn't feel equally confident of Miss Poppleton's
benevolence, but she gave Miss Edith a hug, and
took her advice. She had not lost faith in her father,
only his silence made her fear for his welfare. She
was aware of the many dangers of life in the rough
mining camps where his work lay, and shuddered
as she remembered his tales of attacks by desperadoes,
skirmishes with natives, or perils of wild beasts.
Almost directly, however, her naturally cheerful and
hopeful disposition reasserted itself. She knew letters
sometimes miscarried or were lost, or perhaps her
father might have been ill and unable to write.</p>

<p>"He'll let me hear about him somehow," she said to
herself. "I must just try and be very patient. Dad
desert me! Why, the idea's ridiculous. And I've a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
feeling I'd know if he was dead. No! He's alive
somewhere and thinking of me, and it will all come
right in the end. His very last words were: 'I'll
soon be back to fetch you!' I mustn't let folks at
the school think I don't believe in Dad. That would
never do! I'll show them how I can trust him!"</p>

<p>True to her intention of vindicating her faith in her
father, Gipsy, after the first outburst of tears, took a
pride in concealing her feelings, and preserving at
least an outward appearance of calm confidence. It
certainly needed all her courage to face the situation,
for there were several circumstances which rendered
it peculiarly trying. Miss Poppleton, with whom she
had never been a favourite, snapped at her more frequently
than before, and was harder to please as regarded
both lessons and conduct. Gipsy often felt she
was treated unfairly, and received more than her due
share of blame for any little occurrence that cropped up.</p>

<p>A great many small things contributed to make
her feel her position. Her morning glass of milk,
which all the boarders and some of the day girls took
in the pantry at eleven o'clock, was knocked off, as
were all concerts and lectures where there was a
charge for admission. It was not pleasant, when the
other boarders were taken into Greyfield, to have to
stay behind for the sake of the price of a ticket and
a tram fare. She had long ago spent all her pocket-money,
and there was no more forthcoming. Not
only was she denied such luxuries as chocolates, but
she was not even able to pay her subscription to the
Guild, which, by the new arrangement, was due at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
beginning of each term. The Committee, who knew the
reason and sympathized with her, ignored the matter;
but poor Gipsy, as Secretary, felt her deficiency very
keenly when she made up the accounts. She was a
proud, sensitive girl, and the knowledge that she alone,
of the whole Guild, had not rendered her dues to the
Treasurer was a bitter humiliation.</p>

<p>It was not in regard to the Guild alone that she
was hampered by lack of money. During the spring
term the girls at Briarcroft were accustomed to get
up a small bazaar in aid of a home for waifs and
strays. They were already beginning to work for it,
and Gipsy, who would gladly have helped, made the
unpleasant discovery that it is impossible to make
bricks without straw, or in other words that she had
no materials. Each Form generally took a stall, so
one afternoon there was a little informal meeting of
the Upper Fourth, to discuss what contributions could
be relied upon.</p>

<p>"I vote that each girl undertakes to make a certain
number of articles; that would be far the easiest, and
then we should know how we stand," suggested Alice
O'Connor. "We'll draw up a list, and write it down."</p>

<p>"Need we do it quite that way?" said Hetty Hancock.
"Wouldn't it be enough if each promises to do
what she can?"</p>

<p>"Why? It's much better to nail people."</p>

<p>"Well, you see, it mightn't suit everybody. There's
one girl I know who perhaps really couldn't undertake
to make several things. We don't want her to feel
uncomfortable."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Gipsy was not in the room at that moment, so Hetty
was free to give her hint.</p>

<p>"If you mean Gipsy Latimer, I don't see why we
should spoil the bazaar to spare her feelings!" returned
Alice bluntly.</p>

<p>"I don't want to spoil the bazaar. I only thought
we might do it some other way that wouldn't hurt
her pride."</p>

<p>"What nonsense! People oughtn't to have such
ridiculous pride!" expostulated Gladys Merriman. "I
think Alice's idea is a good one. I'll vote for it if <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'she'">sh</ins>
proposes it properly."</p>

<p>"But surely you wouldn't like it yourself&mdash;" began
Hetty.</p>

<p>"Hush! Here's Gipsy!" said Dilys hastily.</p>

<p>Neither Alice nor Gladys bore any special love for
Gipsy, and they were not particularly desirous to
spare her the unpleasantness of an open confession
of her inability to make her contribution. Perhaps
it was with a spice of malice that Alice rose immediately
and offered her suggestion.</p>

<p>"Each girl could surely undertake at least three
articles&mdash;that ought to be the minimum&mdash;and as
many more as she's capable of doing," she said in
conclusion.</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause in the room. On the
face of it, Alice's proposal was excellent. Everybody
felt it ought to be carried out, but many shared Hetty's
motive in objecting to it. It was Lennie Chapman
who saved the situation.</p>

<p>"I beg to propose an amendment," she put in quickly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
"that, instead of each girl promising things separately,
we may be allowed to form ourselves into working
trios. Three of us could promise a dozen articles between
us, to be made just as we like, all stitching at
the same piece of embroidery if the fancy took us&mdash;just
joint work, in fact. We'd spur each other on in
that way, and get far more finished than if we did it
singly."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" commented Dilys. "Who votes for
the amendment?"</p>

<p>It was carried by half the Form, much to Lennie's
relief. She and Hetty promptly proposed to form a
trio with Gipsy, and were thus able to rescue her from
rather a difficult position.</p>

<p>"But I haven't even a skein of embroidery silk!"
sighed Gipsy afterwards to them in private.</p>

<p>"Never mind! Hetty and I can get the silks, and
you shall do some extra work to make it square. We
shall be exactly quits in that way. You can do all
the painting part, too, on those blotters; you paint
far better than either of us. My flowers are always
scrawny, and yours are lovely. There's an enormous
advantage in working threesomes!"</p>

<p>"Yes, for me!" said Gipsy gratefully.</p>

<p>There are some unworthy natures who cannot resist
the temptation of kicking anyone who is down. It
was very quickly realized at Briarcroft that Gipsy
was in ill favour at headquarters; and though most
of the girls were sorry for her, with a certain number
her changed fortunes undoubtedly lessened her popularity.
Maude Helm never lost an opportunity of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
sneer or a slight, and could sometimes raise a laugh at
Gipsy's expense among the more thoughtless section
of the Form. Gipsy generally responded with spirit,
but the gibes hurt all the same.</p>

</div>

<p>"When are you going to get some new hair ribbons,
Yankee Doodle?" asked Gladys Merriman one day.
"Those red flags of yours are looking rather dejected."</p>

<p>"The American turkey's losing its top-knot," sniggered
Maude tauntingly. "It doesn't soar up aloft
like it used to do! Been a little tamed by the British
lion!"</p>

<p>"If you imagine a turkey to be the crest of the
United States, you're a trifle out," said Gipsy scornfully.</p>

<p>"I'd take to a pigtail if I were you," tittered Maude.
"It only needs one ribbon!"</p>

<p>"If you were me, then I suppose I'd be you&mdash;and,
yes, it might be necessary to change my style of hair-dressing,"
retorted Gipsy, with a glance at Maude's
not too plentiful locks.</p>

<p>Some of the girls giggled, and Cassie Bertram murmured:
"Rats' tails, not pigtails! Or even mouse tails!"</p>

<p>Maude scowled. She had not intended the laugh to
be turned against herself.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't wear limp, faded red bows at any price,"
she commented, banging her desk to close the conversation,
and stalking from the room.</p>

<p>"That Gipsy Latimer's too conceited altogether! I
should like to take her down a peg," she confided to
Gladys, as the pair walked arm-in-arm round the
playground.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, so you do, continually!" said Gladys.</p>

<p>"That's only by the way. She deserves something
more for her American cheek. I'm going to play a
trick on her, Gladys. It'll be ever such fun! Listen!"</p>

<p>The two girls put their heads together, and laughed
as Maude whispered her plan; then they both scuttled
up to the empty classroom, and abstracting Gipsy's
atlas from her desk, carried it downstairs to the lost-property
cupboard, and hid it carefully under a pile of
books.</p>

<p>"She won't find that in a hurry!" chuckled Maude.</p>

<p>"There'll be a fine to-do when she misses it," said
Gladys.</p>

<p>"People who suffer from 'swelled head' just deserve
a little wholesome medicine, to cure them of thinking
too much of themselves. Now she's editor of the Magazine,
Yankee Doodle's unbearable, to my mind. There
are others in the Form who can write stories as well
as herself."</p>

<p>"Yours about the brigands was lovely!" gushed
Gladys obediently.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't boast, but I flatter myself it wasn't
the worst in the Mag. I don't call it fair that everything
should be in the hands of one girl, and she a
foreigner, as one might say! I'll talk to you again
about this, Gladys, for I've got an idea I mean to
exploit later on. Come along now, there's the bell!"</p>

<p>That afternoon the Upper Fourth had a lesson
with Miss Poppleton on "The Work of our Great
Explorers". The class was held in the lecture hall,
and each girl was required to bring with her an atlas,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
a blank book for drawing charts, a notebook, a pencil,
and indiarubber. Gipsy's desk was not always a
miracle of neatness, but she understood its apparent
confusion, and could generally lay her hand in a
moment upon anything she wanted. This afternoon,
however, she rummaged for her atlas in vain. She
turned books and papers over and over in her futile
search, till the desk was in a chaotic muddle.</p>

<p>"Where's my atlas? Who's had my atlas? It was
here yesterday!" she asked agitatedly.</p>

<p>"Really, Gipsy Latimer, I don't wonder you can't
find your things in such an untidy desk!" remarked
Miss White. "You must stay after four o'clock and
put your books in order. Be quick, girls! Ada is
waiting. Are you ready? Then take your places and
march!"</p>

<p>Miss White hurried off to give a botany demonstration
to the Lower Fourth, and the Upper Fourth filed
downstairs to the lecture hall under the superintendence
of Ada Dawkins, monitress for the time in place
of Doreen Tristram, who was absent with influenza.</p>

<p>As the Form stood waiting for a moment or two in
the corridor before entering the lecture hall, Maude
Helm began ostentatiously to count her belongings.</p>

<p>"Pencil&mdash;indiarubber&mdash;map book&mdash;notebook&mdash;and
atlas. I've not forgotten anything!" she said in a
particularly audible whisper.</p>

<p>Ada Dawkins heard, and it reminded her of her
duties. She was anxious to show herself a zealous
monitress.</p>

<p>"Have you all brought your things?" she enquired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
authoritatively. "Face about into line, and hold them
out so that I can see."</p>

<p>The single file of girls wheeled round into a row,
each exhibiting what she carried. Ada passed along
like a commanding officer inspecting a regiment, and
immediately pounced upon Gipsy.</p>

<p>"Where's your atlas, Gipsy Latimer? How is it
you're the only one to forget? Been taken from
your desk? What nonsense! Things don't lose themselves.
If you were tidy, you'd be able to find your
books. No, I'm not going to accept any excuses.
You all know what you want for the lesson, and it's
your own fault if you come without it. Lose two
order marks for leaving your atlas behind, and a third
for arguing! Will you never learn that the monitresses
have some authority here?"</p>

<p>Very much snubbed, poor Gipsy went into the
lecture hall, to be further rebuked by Miss Poppleton
later on for the lack of her atlas. It was only after
a long hunt that she discovered her missing book in
the lost-property cupboard.</p>

<p>"I've a very shrewd guess who put it there, too!"
she remarked to Hetty Hancock. "Maude and Gladys
were giggling something to Alice O'Connor, and they
all looked at me and simply screamed."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say they've played a low,
stingy trick like that upon you?"</p>

<p>"I'm almost sure."</p>

<p>"Then they're mean sneaks! If ever I catch them
at such a thing again, I'll spiflicate them!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>The Millionairess</h3>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">Heard</span> the news?" enquired Barbara Kendrick one
afternoon towards the end of February, lounging into
the Juniors' recreation room with a would-be casual
air, and whistling a jaunty tune which she fondly
hoped was expressive of superior indifference to news
of any kind. Two girls sitting reading by the fire
closed their books, and three at the table, who were in
the agonies of three separate games of patience, temporarily
laid aside their cards.</div>

<p>"No; what's up? Anything decent?" asked Norah
Bell.</p>

<p>Barbara strolled leisurely to the fireplace, and spread
her hands to the blaze. Being a member of the Third,
and having a most interesting piece of information to
communicate, she did not intend to make it too cheap,
and wished to excite the curiosity of the Fourth Form
girls before she vouchsafed to enlighten them.</p>

<p>"Oh! something I heard just now downstairs. I
was passing the Seniors' door, and Allie Spencer came
out and told me."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"She said it concerned your Form."</p>

<p>"Why us particularly?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's going to happen?"</p>

<p>"Is it anything worth knowing, or not?"</p>

<p>"Really, that depends how you take it," said Barbara,
enjoying herself.</p>

<p>"Look here, kiddie, you get on and tell us!"</p>

<p>"Gee up, stupid!"</p>

<p>Barbara paused, prolonging for one more blissful
moment the joy of tantalizing her audience; but in
that moment her chance was lost, for the door opened
suddenly, and in burst Hetty Hancock, like a tempestuous
north wind, proclaiming without either hesitation
or reserve the important tidings.</p>

<p>"I say, isn't it a joke? There's actually a new
boarder coming to-morrow."</p>

<p>"New girls seem to choose odd times to come nowadays,"
said Lennie. "Why didn't she wait till the
half term&mdash;it's only about two weeks off?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps she's been shipwrecked, like I was," suggested
Gipsy.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it! She doesn't come from far. Her
home's only about ten miles off, I believe. Her name's
Leonora Parker."</p>

<p>"Parker! Parker! Surely not the Parkers of Ribblestone
Abbey?" commented Norah Bell.</p>

<p>"I really don't know."</p>

<p>"But I know!" put in Barbara Kendrick, delighted
to score at last by her superior information. "They
are the Parkers of Ribblestone Abbey."</p>

<p>"Then they're most enormously rich people."</p>

<p>"Yes, millionaires! And Leonora's the only child."</p>

<p>"So she's an heiress!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rather&mdash;an heiress of millions."</p>

<p>"You might call her a millionairess, in fact,"
chuckled Gipsy.</p>

<p>"Good for you, Yankee Doodle!"</p>

<p>"I say, it's rather a joke her coming here, isn't it?"
said Norah Bell. "A millionaire's daughter! I wonder
what she'll be like?"</p>

<p>"Sure to have the best of everything," said Daisy
Scatcherd; "the loveliest dresses and the most expensive
hats."</p>

<p>"She won't be able to wear anything but her school
'sailor' here!" commented Dilys. "You needn't imagine
she'll come decked out with diamonds, Daisy."</p>

<p>"She'll have absolutely unlimited pocket-money."</p>

<p>"And be able to buy chocolates and walnut creams
by the pound!" added Barbara enviously.</p>

<p>"Wonder what Form and what dormitory she'll be
in?"</p>

<p>"Well, at any rate I shan't be the last new girl,"
said Gipsy. "I'm glad to retire from the position."</p>

<p>"Yes, Yankee Doodle. Your little nose will be quite
put out of joint."</p>

<p>"A millionairess at Briarcroft! Doesn't it sound
magnificent?"</p>

<p>"What a set of sillies you all are!" said Dilys. "I'm
not going to make any fuss over Leonora, even if she
can buy chocolates by the pound. I'll wait and see
how I like her before I give my opinion. She mayn't
be nice at all."</p>

<p>In spite of Dilys's attitude of aloofness the others
could not help anticipating with the keenest eagerness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the advent of a fresh fellow boarder. The personality
of the "millionairess", as they nicknamed
her, was a subject of much speculation, and a whole
row of noses was flattened against the panes of the
Juniors' sitting-room window to witness her arrival.
The glimpse the girls got of her was distinctly disappointing.
She wore a tweed coat and skirt, and
the orthodox Briarcroft "sailor", with its narrow band
and badge.</p>

<p>"I thought she'd have come in a velvet coat and a
big picture hat full of feathers!" said Barbara, with
rueful surprise in her tone.</p>

<p>"I never dreamt she'd drive up in only a station
cab!" said Norah Bell. "Why didn't she arrive in
her own motor?"</p>

<p>When Leonora was introduced by Miss Poppleton
to her schoolfellows at tea-time, she certainly did not
answer the expectations which had been formed of
her. She was short and rather squat, with heavy
features and nondescript eyes and hair.</p>

<p>"A most stodgy-looking girl," whispered Hetty. "I
don't take to her at all. She's not one half as nice as
Gipsy. By the by, where is Gipsy? I haven't seen
her since four o'clock."</p>

<p>Gipsy came in just then, and took her seat at the
table, looking cold and rather dejected.</p>

<p>"Where've you been?" whispered Hetty.</p>

<p>"Arranging my new room. Didn't you know? I've
been moved out of our dormitory to make way for
Leonora. Miss Edith carried all my things upstairs
this morning."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"How sickening! Is that girl to have your bed?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"And where are you put?"</p>

<p>"In that little box-room on the top floor. The
boxes are all piled at one end, to make room for a
camp bed."</p>

<p>"You don't mean it? Well, I didn't think Poppie
was capable of such a horrid piece of nastiness."</p>

<p>"There's no other place for me at present. I may
be extremely grateful to have that attic, so I'm informed.
You forget I'm a charity girl!" said Gipsy
bitterly.</p>

<p>Poor Gipsy was smarting sorely from a brief conversation
she had had with Miss Poppleton. The
Principal had reminded her in very plain terms of
her dependent position, and had questioned and cross-questioned
her as to whether she could remember any
possible clue by which her father's whereabouts might
be traced. Gipsy had already told all she knew, so
the fresh catechism only seemed to her like the probing
of an old wound. She felt so utterly helpless, so
unable to offer any suggestions, or any way out of the
difficulty. But she stuck tenaciously to her faith in
her father.</p>

<p>"Dad promised to come back for me, and he will!"
she said, with a gleam in her dark eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I know more of the world than you do,
Gipsy, and it looks bad&mdash;very bad indeed!" replied
Miss Poppleton, with a dismal shake of her head.
"Some men are only too anxious to cast off their
responsibilities."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Even Miss Edith, kind as ever though she was,
seemed to take a gloomy view of the case.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, dear&mdash;very sorry!" she said, as she introduced
Gipsy to her attic bedroom. "I don't like to
have to turn you out of your dormitory&mdash;and I'm sure
Miss Poppleton doesn't either! But, you see, we're
obliged to put Leonora there&mdash;and there's no other
place but this. If your father hadn't behaved so
queerly, of course it would have been different. I'm
very sorry, Gipsy&mdash;it's hard on a girl to be left like
this. I wonder he could have the heart to do it. And
it's hard on my sister too. She has to think of ways
and means. Dear, dear! what an amount of trouble
there is in the world! And you're young to have to
begin to feel it. There! I've made you as comfortable
as I can here, child. After all, you'll be downstairs
most of your time."</p>

<p>When Miss Edith had gone away, Gipsy sat down
on the one chair in her room, with a blank, wretched
feeling that was beyond the relief of tears. It was not
that she minded a camp bed in the least, and she had
often slept in far rougher places than her new attic;
but the change seemed the outward and visible sign of
her forlorn circumstances. Both Miss Poppleton's uncompromising
remarks and Miss Edith's well-meant
sympathy hurt her equally, for both expressed the
same doubt of her father's honour. Not until that
afternoon had Gipsy thoroughly realized how utterly
alone she was in the world. Every other girl in the
school had home and parents and relations, while she
had nobody at all except a father who had&mdash;no, not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
forgotten her! that she would never allow; but for
some strange, mysterious reason had been kept from
communicating with her.</p>

<p>Gipsy had too generous a nature to bear Leonora
any grudge for having taken her place in the dormitory.
She even volunteered to give some valuable
hints to the newcomer, knowing by experience the
thorns that were likely to beset her path. Leonora,
however, did not seem at all afflicted by many things
which would have been most trying to Gipsy. She
went her own way stolidly, without reference to her
schoolfellows' comments, good or bad. This attitude
did not satisfy Briarcroft standards, and by the time
she had been there a week she had been weighed in
the balance of public opinion and found decidedly
wanting. She was the exact opposite of what the
boarders had expected. Far from being liberally
disposed, and inclined to spend her superabundant
pocket-money for the good of her companions, she
appeared anxious to take advantage on the other side.
She readily accepted all the chocolates and caramels
that were offered her, but made no return; and if she
bought any sweets she ate them herself in privacy.
She appropriated other girls' hockey sticks, books, or
fountain pens unblushingly, but had always an excuse
if anyone wished to sample her possessions.</p>

<p>"She's the meanest thing I ever met in my life,"
said Lennie Chapman indignantly one day. "She
borrowed my penknife three times this morning, and
when I asked her what had become of her own, she
said it was such a nice one, it seemed a pity to use it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"She spoilt my stylo. yesterday," complained Norah
Bell, "and she never even offered to buy me another."</p>

<p>"She's greedy, too," said Daisy Scatcherd, swelling
the list of Leonora's crimes. "When I handed her
my box of candied fruits, she picked out the very
biggest!"</p>

<p>"How piggie!"</p>

<p>"And yet she's plenty of pocket-money."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, heaps, as much as she likes to ask for."</p>

<p>"I don't see what's the use of being a millionairess
if you're a miser at the same time!" remarked Dilys
scornfully.</p>

<p>A girl who receives everything and dispenses nothing
is never popular among her companions, so it
was scarcely surprising that Leonora won no favour.
A few mercenary spirits, encouraged by the reputation
of her millions, made tentative advances of friendship,
but rapidly withdrew them on the discovery that it
was likely to prove a one-sided bargain.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be friends with her if she owned the
Bank of England!" declared Lennie. "I think she's
too contemptible for words."</p>

<p>"By the by, girls," said Dilys, "it's Miss Edith's
birthday on the 1st of March. Aren't we Junior
boarders going to get up anything in the way of a
present? I know the Seniors are giving her one."</p>

<p>"Rather!" said Fiona Campbell. "I'd stretch a
point for Miss Edie if I was on the verge of bankruptcy.
I vote we open a subscription list. I'm good
for half a crown."</p>

<p>"I expect most of us are," replied Lennie, taking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
paper and pencil to write down names. "Except
Leonora Parker!" she added with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Don't you think she'll give?"</p>

<p>"Not generously."</p>

<p>"Oh, she'll have to!"</p>

<p>"I declare, we'll make her for once!" said Dilys indignantly.
"She shan't sneak out of everything."</p>

<p>"I don't see how you're going to make her."</p>

<p>"The millionairess won't fork out unless she feels
inclined, I can tell you that, my child."</p>

<p>"Just you leave it to me. I'll manage it by fair
means or foul."</p>

<p>"Won't a subscription list make it rather awkward
for Gipsy? You know she can't give anything,"
whispered Hetty Hancock to Dilys.</p>

<p>"Not at all, the way I'm going to do it. I'll take
care of Gipsy, you'll see&mdash;make it easy for her, but
nick in Leonora for more than she bargains."</p>

<p>"You're cleverer than I thought you were."</p>

<p>"Ah, you haven't plumbed the depths of my genius
yet, my good child. Now when Leonora&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush! Here she comes."</p>

<p>The millionairess walked to the fireplace, and stood
leaning over the high fender, sharpening a cherished
stump of lead pencil.</p>

<p>"We're getting up a subscription," began Dilys,
opening the attack without further delay. "It's to
buy a present for Miss Edith's birthday. You'd like
us to put your name down, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not sure," replied Leonora cautiously.
"What are most of you giving?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Half a crown," replied a chorus of voices.</p>

<p>"I've been at Briarcroft such a short time," demurred
Leonora. "Perhaps it would really be better
if the present came from you, who are all old
pupils."</p>

<p>"There's something in that," said Dilys. "Both you
and Gipsy Latimer have only been here a little while,
so it would be more appropriate, after all, to leave you
both out of it, and let it be an old girls' gift. Lennie,
do you hear? You're not to put down either Gipsy
or Leonora, however much they beg and pray."</p>

<p>"Right-oh!" said Lennie rather sulkily. She thought
that Dilys, in her delicacy for Gipsy, was sparing
Leonora too much. But Dilys gave her a withering
look, which so plainly implied: "Trust me to mind
my own business" that she began hastily to hum a
tune.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'd like to give Miss Edith something
on your own account," suggested Dilys craftily to the
millionairess.</p>

<p>"Exactly. It would be far better than my joining
with the rest of you," agreed Leonora, jumping at such
an easy way out.</p>

<p>"Tell me what it's to be, then, and we'll ask Miss
Lindsay to order it."</p>

<p>"Oh! I can get it myself, thanks."</p>

<p>"We're not allowed. All shopping has to be done
through Miss Lindsay. I should suggest a book."</p>

<p>"I dare say that would do. There was one of yours
that Miss Edith was looking at yesterday."</p>

<p>"Do you mean my small 'Christina Rossetti'? All<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
right. Lennie, put down that Leonora Parker wants
to order a copy of Christina Rossetti's poems."</p>

<p>Thus cornered, Leonora was obliged to consent.
Dilys's little book was a shilling edition&mdash;not ruinous,
certainly, to the purse strings; so comparing that with
a subscription of half a crown she considered she had
escaped cheaply.</p>

<p>"You've let her off too easily," grumbled Lennie
afterwards, as she added up her list. "It's a shame
the richest girl in the class should give the least."</p>

<p>"I haven't finished with her yet, my friend&mdash;I've
only begun!" chuckled Dilys. "Let me go to Miss
Lindsay."</p>

<p>Dilys had a deep-laid scheme, which she considered
too good to be divulged at present, but which she
hoped would be the undoing of Leonora. She went
to the mistresses' room with the subscription list, and
handed the collection of half-crowns to Miss Lindsay.</p>

<p>"Would you please order a Russia leather blotter for
Miss Edith?" she said. "We've decided on that, unless
you know of anything she'd like better. Leonora
Parker would like to give her a separate present,
quite on her own account."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" said Miss Lindsay, who had not yet
grasped the new pupil's economical tendencies. "Then
I suppose she wishes it to be something handsome?"</p>

<p>"She mentioned a copy of Christina Rossetti's poems,
but she said nothing about the price," returned Dilys
stolidly.</p>

<p>"Christina Rossetti's poems? Then she must surely
mean that beautiful illustrated edition that we were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
talking about at tea-time yesterday. I remember Miss
Edith said how immensely she would like to see it.
No doubt Leonora made a mental note of it. It was
a kind thought of hers, which Miss Edith will appreciate,
I am sure."</p>

<p>"Is the edition expensive?" enquired Dilys casually.</p>

<p>"Fifteen shillings net, but of course to Leonora that
is a mere nothing&mdash;no more than sixpence to most
girls. Still, perhaps I'd better send for her and ask
her."</p>

<p>"She's having her music lesson," put in Dilys
quickly.</p>

<p>"The order ought to go off at once, if we are to
have the presents in time for the 1st of March," said
Miss Lindsay, glancing at the clock. "I must write
now to catch the post. I think I may venture to
send Leonora's commission without consulting her.
She must certainly mean the illustrated edition, and
in her case we really need not trouble to consider the
question of the price."</p>

<p>Dilys went away, rubbing her hands with satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Serves you right, Leonora Parker!" she chuckled
to herself. "Your little effort at economy is going to
cost you rather more than you bargained for. Miss
Lindsay's an absolute trump. I hate mean people
who hoard up their money and keep it all for themselves."</p>

<p>She confided her success to the others, but exacted
a promise of strict secrecy.</p>

<p>"We'll simply say Miss Lindsay has sent for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
book," she advised. "I believe Leonora would be capable
of countermanding the order if she knew the
amount of the bill. It will be a surprise for her later
on."</p>

<p>"And a ripping joke for us!"</p>

<p>"It's Miss Lindsay's fault, though. She named the
edition."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course! We understand that, my dear
girl!"</p>

<p>The presents arrived by return of post, just in time
for Miss Edith's birthday&mdash;a splendid blotter of delicious-smelling
leather, and the edition of Christina
Rossetti's poems, a large and handsome volume full
of beautiful illustrations. Miss Lindsay brought them
into the Juniors' sitting-room, and showed them to the
delighted girls.</p>

<p>"It was so nice of you, Leonora dear, to think of
giving such a lovely gift to Miss Edith all on your
own account," she remarked; "so thoughtful to have
fixed upon the very thing she wanted. You meant
this edition, of course? I knew I could hardly be
mistaken. Miss Edith will be particularly pleased
that a new girl should show such appreciation. The
pictures are perfect gems. We'll wrap the book up
again in its various papers, and you must hide it carefully
away until to-morrow. Would you like to give
me the fifteen shillings now, or will Miss Poppleton
stop it out of your allowance?"</p>

<p>Leonora's face was a study. Blank amazement
struggled with disgust, and for a moment she seemed
almost tempted to deny all responsibility for having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
given the order. Pride, however, at the sight of the
sneer at the corners of Dilys Fenton's mouth, came to
her rescue. She knew the girls had tricked her, and
she was determined not to afford them the satisfaction
of an open triumph.</p>

<p>"Thank you very much, Miss Lindsay, for getting
the book," she replied calmly. "I'll give you the
money now, please. I'm glad it's the edition Miss
Edith wants," and taking her parcel, she sailed from
the room, without deigning to glance at the others.</p>

<p>"Done her this time!" chuckled Dilys. "It'll do
her good to shell out for once."</p>

<p>"She took it awfully well, though! Perhaps on the
whole she wasn't altogether sorry. Miss Edie's such
a dear, anyone would want to give her nice things
who'd got the money," sighed Gipsy, whose own offering
was limited to a little pen-and-ink drawing of the
house.</p>

<p>"She's not so bad on the whole, though she isn't
liberal in the way of sweets," remarked Daisy
Scatcherd.</p>

<p>"You greedy pig!" said Dilys. "We don't want
her to keep us provided with chocolates. As long as
she's fair, that's all I care about. I think it's sickening
to try and truckle to her because she's so rich.
If you wanted to get anything out of her, I'm glad
you were disappointed. 'Give and take' and 'Share
and share alike' are the best mottoes for school."</p>

<p>"Thanks for the sermon!" said Daisy sarcastically.</p>

<p>"I don't care if you do call it preaching!" retorted
Dilys. "When first Leonora came, some of you made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
such a ridiculous fuss over her, I was quite disgusted.
A girl ought to be judged on her own merits, not by
what her father's got. If she shows herself ready to
take a fair part in everything, and be of some service
to the school, then I'll approve of her, and not till
then."</p>

<p>"Hear, hear!" cried Hetty Hancock.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>Gipsy turns Champion</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Each</span> Form at Briarcroft had its own teacher, but in
addition there were a certain number of visiting masters
and mistresses who came out from Greyfield to
give lessons at the school. A few were popular, some
were tolerated, and one or two were cordially disliked.
Among those who had the ill fortune to encounter
strong opposition was Fr&auml;ulein Hochmeyer, the singing
mistress. She was a most conscientious teacher
and a clever musician, but so intensely German in
both accent and methods that she offended the British
susceptibilities of her pupils, and inspired more ridicule
than respect. Poor Fr&auml;ulein meant so well, it was
really very hard that her efforts did not meet with
better results. She treated her classes exactly as she
would have dealt with similar ones in Germany; but
what might have pleased apple-cheeked, pig-tailed
Gretchens did not at all suit the taste of the Briarcroft-ites,
particularly the members of the Lower
School. They refused even to smile at her heavy
Teutonic jokes, mocked her accent, rebelled at the
numerous German songs they were expected to learn,
whispered, giggled, and talked during the lesson, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
generally made it extremely difficult for her to keep
order. In vain she alternately pleaded, conciliated,
flustered, fumed, and even threatened. The girls
would not behave seriously, and though they did not
deign to laugh at her attempts at humour, they treated
her as a joke. As she was decidedly stout and rosy
they nicknamed her "German Sausage", and made fun
of her almost to her face.</div>

<p>A part of Fr&auml;ulein Hochmeyer's system of voice
production which her pupils much detested was learning
the proper position of the mouth. It was of course
a most important and necessary part of the lesson, but
owing to the way it was enforced the silly girls turned
it all into ridicule. Fr&auml;ulein would stand upon the
platform giving a practical demonstration to show
how the lips must be well drawn back, revealing the
teeth parted about the third of an inch, so as to offer
no obstruction to the free passage of the voice; and
she would require her pupils to stand at attention
with their mouths thus fixed before beginning the
preliminary exercises.</p>

<p>"We look like a set of grinning imbeciles!" complained
Lennie Chapman, "with Sausage for the
arch-lunatic of us all. I wish to goodness we had
a decent English teacher! I don't like these foreign
ways."</p>

<p>"You'd like it still less if you were turned into a
pattern pupil like me!" grumbled Gipsy. "I hate
making an exhibition of myself."</p>

<p>Gipsy, being an apt copyist, was able to set her
mouth at exactly the right angle, and in consequence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
her approving teacher would frequently beckon her
on to the platform with the invitation:</p>

<p>"Dear friendt, com here and show ze ozers how you
do open ze mouz."</p>

<p>The letters "th" were an impossibility to Fr&auml;ulein's
German tongue, and the girls giggled continually at
the "z's" that replaced them. Gipsy was not at all
proud of being forced to set an example to the class,
and would ascend the platform with an ill grace, and
look the reverse of flattered at the encouraging pats
that were bestowed upon her shoulders. Really Fr&auml;ulein
had the kindest heart in the world, and tried, in
her heavy fashion, to be on excellent terms with her
pupils, but she did not in the least comprehend the
mind of the British schoolgirl.</p>

<p>"She treats us exactly as if we were kindergarten
babies!" sneered Hetty Hancock. "I don't know how
German girls of our age would enjoy her silly jokes,
but I think she's a rotter!"</p>

<p>"And she's so sentimental!" hinnied Daisy Scatcherd.
"I nearly had a fit when she began to troll out that
love song, with her hand laid touchingly on her heart."</p>

<p>"That sort of rubbish may go down in the Fatherland,
but it doesn't here."</p>

<p>The girls had waxed restive at many of the <i>Lieder</i>
which they were obliged to learn, but when Fr&auml;ulein
turned up one morning with a volume of songs of
her own composition, their discontent verged towards
mutiny.</p>

<p>"Ze original vords are, of course, in German," explained
Fr&auml;ulein, "but I have had a translation made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
for you by a friendt of mine, and it is sehr gut. Ze
first it is a cradle song. Now, I ask has any girl in
ze class got at home a leetle, leetle brozer or sister?"</p>

<p>"I have," volunteered Mary Parsons bluntly. "A
brother."</p>

<p>"And how old?"</p>

<p>"Six months."</p>

<p>"Ach! Zat is beautiful! You shall sing zis song
to ze leetle baby in ze cradle, vile you rock him gently,
gently, till he sleep!" and Fr&auml;ulein gazed ecstatically
at Mary, as if calling up a mental picture of her
sisterly attention.</p>

<p>"He'd soon squall if I did!" grunted Mary to her
neighbour, who exploded audibly.</p>

<p>"You, who are not so all-fortunate as to have a
baby in ze home, must sing it to ze child of a neighbour,"
went on Fr&auml;ulein, evidently determined that
the value of the lullaby should receive a practical
trial.</p>

<p>"And what are we boarders to do?" enquired Lennie
Chapman ironically.</p>

<p>"Sing it to the cat!" whispered Hetty, whereat the
bystanders tittered.</p>

<p>"You've stumped her there!" murmured Fiona.</p>

<p>Fr&auml;ulein certainly for a moment looked a little at a
loss, but she soon recovered her presence of mind.</p>

<p>"Vait till ze holidays, zen you sall see!" she returned
with an engaging smile. "I shall now sing
von or two of ze lieder to you, to show you vat zey
are like."</p>

<p>The music of the songs was beautiful, that was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
allowed by even the most unappreciative of the girls.
There was a joyous lilt and a true melody about them
that put them high in the rank of composition, and
the accompaniments played with Fr&auml;ulein's delicate
touch were harmonious and suitable. The words, unfortunately,
were childish in the extreme, and more
fit for youngsters of five than girls of eleven to fourteen.
Even the members of the Lower Third turned
up supercilious noses. They were further marred by
Fr&auml;ulein's accent, and when she unctuously rendered</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Hush, my baby, sweetest, best,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Little mousie's gone to rest",</span><br />

<div class='unindent'>as</div>

<div class='poem'>
"Hosh, my baby, sveetest, best,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Leetle moozie's gone to rest",</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>a ripple of mirth passed round the class.</div>

<p>Having gone through one or two as specimens,
Fr&auml;ulein selected the lullaby and set the girls to work
at it. I am afraid that, instead of doing their best,
they only sang in mockery. Fiona Campbell made a
pretence cradle of her arm, and rocked it for Mary
Parsons' benefit; and Gipsy put an amount of sham
sentiment into her execution calculated to convulse
the others. At the end of the lesson the class trooped
away in a state of frank rebellion.</p>

<p>"Really, this is too much!" protested Dilys Fenton.
"We can't be expected to sing her silly songs."</p>

<p>"It's just baby nonsense!" exclaimed Norah Bell.</p>

<p>"The music's pretty," said Joyce Adamson.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, the music&mdash;but look at the words!" scoffed
Gipsy, turning over the pages of the new copies. "Did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
you ever see anything so absolutely idiotic in all your
life as this?</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Old hare's little son<br />

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Just see how he spins</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">On his dear little pins!'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"It's an affront to ask us to learn such rubbish!"
declared the outraged girls. "We shall really have
to speak to Poppie about it."</p>

<p>"Yes, a good idea! Let's complain to Poppie."</p>

<p>"If she'll listen."</p>

<p>"She's not generally so ready to hear our grievances."</p>

<p>"Well, something will have to be done, for we can't
go on week after week with this baby stuff. It's like
turning back to one's ABC. I declare we'd more
sensible songs when I was in the Kindergarten."</p>

<p>"I'll take my book home, and perhaps I can get my
mother to write a letter to Poppie about it," suggested
Mary Parsons.</p>

<p>"You! Why, you're the one who's to sit serenading
over your infant brother's cradle!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps Sausage will bring a doll to school next
week and make us practise with it in turns! She'd
be quite capable of it," sniggered Maude Helm.</p>

<p>Nobody plucked up sufficient courage to interview
Miss Poppleton on the subject. It is one thing for
schoolgirls to growl, and quite another to venture to
remonstrate with the Principal about the lessons. Miss
Poppleton was not an approachable person, and except<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
in extreme cases her pupils did not venture to get up
deputations. Gipsy voiced the opinions of the class,
however, in airing their grievances to Miss Edith, and
gave her an animated account of their special bug-bear,
the new song book.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me, Gipsy! I'm very sorry!" said Miss
Edith, puckering up her forehead anxiously. "I'm
afraid you girls behave very badly in the singing
class. You ought to have more respect for Fr&auml;ulein
Hochmeyer. I hope Mary Parsons' mother won't
write about it. It puts Miss Poppleton in a most
awkward position when parents make complaints.
We don't want to change our singing mistress, Fr&auml;ulein's
system of voice production is so very good. She
was a pupil of Randegger, I believe. There's no other
first-class teacher in Greyfield either except Mr. Johnson,
and he doesn't take half the trouble with his
pupils that Fr&auml;ulein does. I wish you girls would
try to appreciate her more."</p>

<p>Gipsy screwed up her mouth and looked humorous
in reply.</p>

<p>"But she's a beautiful character, if you only knew!"
urged Miss Edith. "She's so simple and kind-hearted;
and she works so hard! She has an invalid father to
keep. He's quite dependent on her, I believe. They
live in lodgings in Greyfield. I'm sure I'm often sorry
for her, going about to her pupils in all weathers. It's
too bad of you girls to make such fun of her! She's a
stranger in a strange land, poor thing, with no friends
here, and her living to make. Girls are a thoughtless
set, as I've found out long ago. You might try to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
have a little more consideration for her, Gipsy. Just
imagine yourself in her place, and fancy you were
teaching a class of German girls! Yes, as I said
before, I'm sorry for Fr&auml;ulein Hochmeyer. She has
a hard time of it."</p>

<p>Gipsy said nothing, but she retired with ample food
for thought. It had never struck her before to take
the view of Fr&auml;ulein that Miss Edith had just presented.
The little foreign peculiarities and eccentricities
had excited her mirth, but she had quite missed
the sterling good qualities that lay underneath them.
"'A stranger in a strange land, with no friends here'&mdash;I
know what that means!" muttered Gipsy to herself.
"It's brave of her to work to keep her father!
Don't I just wish I&mdash;" but here she sighed, for the
unuttered wish seemed so entirely hopeless and futile.</p>

<p>After revolving the matter carefully, Gipsy made
up her mind that Fr&auml;ulein Hochmeyer deserved to
be helped instead of hindered.</p>

<p>"Though how I'm to do it when she insists on forcing
those absurd baby songs upon us, I can't tell.
Stop! I've an idea. Oh, I don't know whether I can,
but I mean to have a jolly good try! No time like
the present. I've half an hour before tea." And furnishing
herself with pencil and paper, she ran up to
her attic, and was soon puckering her brows in the
agonies of composition. As the result of that and
several other half-hours of work, she covered two
pages of foolscap; then, seeking out Miss Edith, she
unfolded her scheme and begged for help.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you'll think it fearful cheek of me,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
she began, "but you see the trouble at present in
the singing class is that we all abominate those silly
little songs. They really sound foolish for girls of our
age. Of course Fr&auml;ulein's composed them herself, and
the tunes are very nice. Do you think she'd mind
changing the words? It wouldn't matter to her what
we were singing so long as the music was the same,
would it? But it would make all the difference to us.
I made up a few verses that go with the tunes just
as well. They're here, if you don't mind looking at
them," and Gipsy modestly unfolded her manuscript.

</div>

<p>"Very creditable, Gipsy. Really not at all bad,"
commented Miss Edith.</p>

<p>"I know they're not up to much," said Gipsy apologetically,
"but oh! Miss Edith, I believe the girls
would much rather sing them than the other words.
They're about the school, you see. I daren't ask
Fr&auml;ulein myself; do you think you could?" and Gipsy
turned quite red at the boldness of her own suggestion.</p>

<p>"It might be a good idea. Give me the paper, and
I'll see what I can do."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, thanks so much! I hope Fr&auml;ulein won't be
offended."</p>

<p>Miss Edith's gentle tact could often accomplish
things where other measures might have failed. Nobody
ever heard how she explained the situation and
persuaded Fr&auml;ulein Hochmeyer to adopt the alterations,
but before the next singing lesson all the obnoxious
song books were collected and Gipsy's versions,
neatly printed by hand on slips of paper, were pasted
over the old words of the two songs in question.</p>

<p>"I hear you not like to sing about hares and
babies?" commented Fr&auml;ulein. "So! It must be all
about school? Yes. You have among you von who
can write in verse" (nodding cheerily to the abashed
Gipsy). "My friendt, you shall make for us some
more verses to suit ze ozer songs!"</p>

<p>Having determined to act as Fr&auml;ulein's champion,
Gipsy tried her utmost to sway popular opinion in
favour of the luckless singing mistress. It was a far
harder task, though, than she had anticipated, and put
her powers of leadership to a severe test. It had
been easy enough to induce the Juniors to stand up
for their own rights, but it was considerably more
difficult to make them realize anybody else's claims to
consideration.</p>

<p>"Do let's be nice to her!" pleaded Gipsy. "She's
really a very decent sort on the whole. She can't
help being a foreigner and talking with a queer
accent."</p>

<p>"Why, you were the first to make fun of her last
week," objected some of the girls.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know, but it was rather horrid. Her story's
quite romantic, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"Can't see much romance about our homely German
Sausage!" giggled Daisy Scatcherd.</p>

<p>"Put a bunch of forget-me-nots in her hair, and
she'll look a heroine!" tittered Norah Bell.</p>

<p>"Yankee Doodle, when you ride a hobby you ride
it to death! What's induced you to take such a
sudden and violent affection for the Sausage?"</p>

<p>"You'll be standing perennially on the platform
now, holding your teeth like a dentist's advertisement,
to show us how to 'open ze mouz'!"</p>

<p>"I wish you'd revise the schoolbooks and cut out
the difficult parts!"</p>

<p>"Go on! Rag me as much as you like. I don't
care!" retorted Gipsy sturdily.</p>

<p>"I've brought this picture of a sausage," piped one
of the smaller girls. "I'm going to pin it on to the
piano. She knows we call her 'Sausage'! She'll be
in such a rage!"</p>

<p>"You little horror!" said Gipsy, seizing the picture
and tearing it into shreds before the eyes of its
enraged owner.</p>

<p>On the whole, though her championship was treated
as a joke, Gipsy's influence had a beneficial effect, and
the general behaviour in the singing class began
steadily to improve. Her Briarcroft songs were appreciated,
and the girls sang them lustily and trolled
out the chorus with vigour. The tunes were very
catchy and bright, and everybody seemed constantly
to be humming them, in season or out of season.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your 'Hurrah! for the dear old School!' has got in
my brain, Yankee Doodle," said Mary Parsons. "It
haunts me all day long, and I can't get rid of it."</p>

<p>"We'll sing it in the lecture hall on the last day
of the term. Poppie'd be quite flattered," said Hetty
Hancock.</p>

<p>"With a special cheer for Fr&auml;ulein Hochmeyer,
then!" added Gipsy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>A Spartan Maiden</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> Spring Term was passing rapidly, and Gipsy had
now been nearly six months at Briarcroft. It felt a
very, very long time to her since the first evening
when she had introduced herself in so sprightly a
fashion to her fellow boarders, and had given them
a graphic account of the shipwreck. The old Gipsy
of last October and the new Gipsy of the present
March seemed like two different people, with a whole
world of experience to divide them. The well-conducted
regime of Briarcroft had had its due effect,
and had considerably toned down her unconventional
Colonial ways; while the trouble through which she
was passing, like all seasons of adversity, had made
her older and more thoughtful than before. There
was still no news of any kind from her father, and
no answer had yet been received from the cousins
in New Zealand. Miss Poppleton's manner towards
Gipsy hardened a little more each week that mail
day arrived and brought no solution of the problem
where her school fees were to come from. At present
her attitude was that of grim acceptance of a most
unwelcome burden. She was not actively unkind,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and no doubt thought she was behaving very generously
in keeping Gipsy at Briarcroft at all, but in
a variety of small ways she made the girl feel the
humiliation of her position.</div>

<p>To poor Gipsy the difficulties appeared to accumulate
more and more. The clothes which her father had
bought for her in Liverpool were fast wearing out, and
there seemed not the slightest prospect of renewing
any of them. In a school where the girls were always
well, if simply dressed, it was not pleasant to be the
only one in worn skirts, washed-out blouses, patched
boots, mended gloves, and faded hair ribbons. Gipsy
had never before been stinted in either clothing or
pocket-money, and it hurt her pride sorely. But in
spite of her shabby attire she looked a distinguished
little figure, with her straight, upright habit of carriage,
and quick alertness of manner. The sadness in her dark
eyes gave her a new dignity, and though a few girls
might pass ill-natured remarks about her clothes, her
general prestige in the school remained the same. There
was an individuality about Gipsy which marked her
out, and raised her above the ordinary level. She was
full of original ideas, and had a persuasive way of
stating her views that invariably won her a following.
The girls were becoming accustomed to consult her
on any important topic, and tacitly if not openly regarded
her as the Captain of the Lower School. With
some the fact that she was "down on her luck" invested
her with a flavour of romance, more especially
as she was very reserved on the subject.</p>

<p>"I never dare ask Gipsy a word about her father,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
said Hetty Hancock. "She shuts up like an oyster if
one throws out the faintest hint."</p>

<p>"Do you think she still believes in him?" queried
Mary Parsons.</p>

<p>"Rather! And I admire her for it. She's shown
splendid spirit all this time, and never once given in.
She's a real Spartan."</p>

<p>"Yes, Gipsy's as game as can be," commented Dilys.
"She never looks beaten, however hard Poppie snubs
her, and Poppie's just abominable sometimes."</p>

<p>"I'm often dying to help Gipsy," said Hetty. "But
one can't help her. She'd be desperately offended if
one offered to lend her pocket-money, or anything."</p>

<p>"You'd better not try! No, I believe Gipsy's pride
wouldn't let her borrow so much as a yard of hair
ribbon, however badly she needed it."</p>

<p>"Rather different from Leonora, who borrows everything
she can persuade people to lend her."</p>

<p>"Don't speak to me of Leonora! I rue the day she
came into our dormitory. She snores at night till I
have to get up and shake her. We call her 'Snorer'
now, instead of 'Leonora'. I wish Poppie'd put her
in the attic, instead of Gipsy."</p>

<p>"Trust Poppie not to banish the millionairess!
She's ever so proud of having her at the school."</p>

<p>"H'm! Her company's a doubtful privilege, in my
opinion."</p>

<p>"Yet Poppie had the cheek to suggest that we
ought to make her a Guild officer."</p>

<p>"No! Did she?" exclaimed the girls. "It's not
Poppie's business to interfere in our affairs. We'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
manage them for ourselves, thank you! We've got
rid of the Seniors, and we're not going to let her
dictate what we must do."</p>

<p>Under Gipsy's fostering care the various branches
of the United Guild had prospered exceedingly. She
was a most zealous and enterprising secretary, sparing
no trouble to make things a success, and capable of
organizing all kinds of new departures. She had got
up a photographic exhibition, and collected quite a
nice little show of snapshots, neatly mounted on
brown paper, and pinned round the play-room. She
persuaded Miss White to allow the Form to start a
museum in an empty desk that stood in a corner, and
spurred on the day girls to bring specimens for it of
birds' eggs, stones, pressed flowers, and any curiosities
with which they would consent to part. She made a
neat catalogue of the exhibits, with the names of the
donors, and then broached a scheme for a series of
museum lectures; but at that even her stanchest
adherents turned tail.</p>

<p>"Got too many irons in the fire already to find time
to write learned papers on Natural History, Yankee
Doodle," objected Lennie. "One would have to cram
it all up out of the encyclop&aelig;dia, and that's too hard
work for this child!"</p>

<p>"Wait till we have a museum anniversary, then
we'll appoint you curator, and you shall spout for the
occasion," suggested Hetty.</p>

<p>A sketching club among the artistically disposed
members of the Lower School met with some response,
especially as it developed into a monthly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
competition. Gipsy boldly begged some attractive
prints from the drawing mistress to serve as prizes,
and, having chosen a subject to be illustrated, pinned
up the various attempts, signed with pseudonyms, and
took the voting of the whole of the Juniors to decide
the awards&mdash;an exciting occasion which everybody
considered worthy of repetition. Gipsy's restless,
energetic temperament was her salvation at this
particular crisis of her career. If she had allowed
herself to brood over her troubles, she would have
been wretched indeed; but by throwing herself heartily
into schemes for the general good of the community
she succeeded in being, if not exactly happy, at any
rate a useful and cheerful addition to the school.</p>

<p>The Sale of Work took place in March, and though
she had not a single penny to spend on it, she contributed
excellent service in other ways. She was
indefatigable in assisting to arrange stalls, write programmes,
or do any of the necessary drudgery that
a bazaar always entails. Even the Seniors acknowledged
her helpfulness, and Helen Roper admitted
that "if one wanted a thing done quickly, Gipsy
Latimer was worth a dozen of those other kids". In
the matter of the Sale of Work the hatchet had been
buried between the Upper and the Lower Schools, and
both co-operated to make the affair a success. Now
that the rights of the Juniors were fully established,
and their claims to consideration recognized, Gipsy
was only too pleased to help the older girls, and
ran about holding step-ladders, handing tacks, fetching
articles wanted, and generally doing odd jobs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Encouraged by the conciliatory attitude of the Seniors,
she ventured to propose a scheme suggested by her
foreign experience.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't we turn the tea-room into a caf&eacute;
chantant?" she said. "We should get far more
money in that way than if people only went in for
refreshments. Charge them an admission, and then
tea extra. They'll stay far longer, and take more
things, if music and singing are going on all the time.
It's really better than a separate concert, too, because
you can't always get people to go to the concerts, but
hardly anyone can resist tea at four o'clock."</p>

<p>After talking it over, the Seniors were graciously
pleased to adopt Gipsy's idea, and began to draw up
a programme for the caf&eacute; chantant. Their struggle
of the past had taught them a lesson in fair play, and
they therefore proposed to admit a certain number of
Juniors as performers, instead of, as formerly, keeping
the whole thing in their own hands.</p>

<p>"I've put you down for two solos, Gipsy Latimer,"
said Helen Roper magnanimously. "What would you
like to sing?"</p>

<p>Gipsy thought for a moment before she replied:</p>

<p>"I wonder if it would be possible to borrow a banjo?
I used to play one out in America, and I know some
very pretty Creole songs, and one or two Spanish
ones."</p>

<p>"My brother has a banjo that he'd lend, I'm sure,"
said Lena Morris.</p>

<p>"Good! We'll rig you out as a Spanish gipsy,"
agreed Helen. "There are lots of things in our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
dramatic property box that would come in. You'd
look the part no end!"</p>

<p>"I'll send the banjo this evening, so that you can
practise it," volunteered Lena.</p>

<p>Naturally the afternoon of the bazaar was a great
event at Briarcroft. Stalls had been put up in the
lecture hall, and were prettily draped with muslin,
while the walls of the room were decorated with flags,
festoons of laurel leaves, and Chinese lanterns hung
from wires stretched across the platform. The flower
stall was a particular success, with its great bunches of
daffodils, narcissus, violets, and other spring blossoms,
and pots of tulips, lily of the valley, and hyacinths.
Leonora had for once risen to the occasion. She had
written home to her mother for contributions, and
Mrs. Parker had responded generously, sending a
quantity of beautiful flowers and pot plants to be
sold, and lending some of the finest palms in her conservatory
to help to deck the room.</p>

<p>By three o'clock everything was in order for patrons,
and really the arrangements reflected great credit upon
the Committee. All the stalls were well laden with
articles. Some of the Seniors had been busy making
beautiful things. Doreen Tristram, who was taking
lessons in china painting, brought some charming little
teacups and saucers, painted with sprays of flowers.
Helen Roper sent some excellent woodcarving, and
there was every description of needlecraft&mdash;traycloths
in fine drawn threadwork, doilys, cushions, tea cosies,
nightdress cases, table centres, and other dainty
bits of embroidery. By the appointed hour, groups<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
of parents and friends began to arrive, and the hall
was soon full. The Lady Mayoress of Greyfield had
consented to open the sale, and made an excellent
speech, explaining the object for which the money
was being raised, and urging the claims of the home
for waifs and strays. She herself set a good example
by purchasing a number of articles at various stalls,
and the visitors followed suit liberally.</p>

<p>The girls hovered about, picking and choosing what
they should buy, according to the state of their purses
or their individual tastes. A novel feature, much
patronized by the Juniors, was a Surprise Packet
table. All kinds of tempting little articles were
wrapped up in gay tissue paper, and purchased somewhat
on the system of "buying a pig in a poke", an
arrangement that at any rate afforded great amusement
when the parcels were untied. The stalls soon
began to exhibit a welcome bareness, and the stall-holders
felt the fullness of their bags with satisfaction.
Towards four o'clock everybody showed a tendency
to migrate in the direction of the caf&eacute; chantant. This
had been arranged in the largest of the classrooms.
Tea was served at small tables while a concert proceeded,
the guests being expected to retire after about
ten minutes, so as to make room for others.</p>

<p>Helen Roper had got together quite a good programme.
Irma Dalton, a Second Form day girl, a
dainty, fairy-like child, gave a graceful performance
of step dancing, Doreen Tristram played the violin,
and there were piano solos and songs from other
members. Everyone acknowledged, however, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Gipsy was the star of the occasion. She was dressed
specially for her part in a kind of half-Spanish costume,
with a red skirt, a black velvet bodice over
white sleeves, and a muslin fichu trimmed with lace.
Her rich dark hair was allowed to hang loose, and
a gold-embroidered gauze scarf was twisted lightly
round the top of her head, the long ends falling below
her waist. She wore sequin ornaments and a quantity
of Oriental bangles, which enhanced the fantastic
effect, and gave her the appearance of a true Romany.
She was not at all afflicted with shyness, and performed
her share of the entertainment with a zest
that charmed her audience. Her southern songs, with
their crooning refrains, seemed to bring visions of
moonlit lagoons and the luscious scent of tropical
flowers. She accompanied herself quite prettily on
the banjo, and had a stock of encores ready to meet
the demands for a further exhibition of her skill. She
was such a success that her fame spread over the
bazaar. People came into the caf&eacute; chantant specially
to hear her, and everyone was asking who that bonny,
gipsy-looking girl was that sang the charming Creole
melodies.</p>

<p>"We've taken exactly three times the money by
the refreshment room that we did last year," said
Helen Roper, counting up the gains afterwards.</p>

<p>"It was a ripping idea of Gipsy's to add the music!"
said Hetty Hancock, always anxious to put in a good
word for her friend.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll give Gipsy the credit that's due to her,"
allowed Helen. "She's worked hard over this affair,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
and behaved more decently than I expected. I think
she's improved. She's not nearly so perky and cheeky
as when she first came. She may turn out quite a
nice girl yet."</p>

<p>"Wonders will never cease! Praise for Gipsy from
Helen Roper!" gasped Hetty to Lennie Chapman.</p>

<p>Gipsy, in her editorial capacity, wrote a most vivid
report of the bazaar for the <i>Juniors' Journal</i>, putting
in a variety of grand words and flowery turns of
speech calculated to impress her readers. She had
taken special pains with this number of the Magazine.
The chapter of her serial story was longer and
more exciting than ever; under the heading of "Our
Library Shelf" she had reviewed several books; she
had written a leading article on the tennis and cricket
prospects for the forthcoming season; and by ceaseless
urging had kept her contributors, who were apt to
slack off, up to the mark in respect of literary matter.
Fiona Campbell had been persuaded to illustrate Norah
Bell's storyette; Blanche Russell had sent an account
of a winter holiday ski-ing in Norway; the Exchange
and Mart had been fuller than ever of offers of silkworms,
garden plants, and miscellaneous possessions;
and Gipsy had appended a catalogue of the Museum,
with an appeal for more donations of specimens.</p>

<p>"Our journal now seems a going concern, and a
well-established feature of the Lower School; it is
earnestly to be hoped that everyone will make a
supreme effort to ensure its success, and that more
members will take their share in swelling its pages.
Criticisms and suggestions are freely invited, and will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
be discussed at the General Meeting to be held next
Friday, 21 March, at 4 p.m., in the dressing-room."</p>

<p>So wrote Gipsy, and thought no more about the
matter. This portion of her editorial address, however,
was seized upon by several of the girls, and led
to results which she had certainly not expected.</p>

<p>"Wants criticisms, does she?" said Maude Helm.
"Well, I'll guarantee she'll get them for once."</p>

<p>"And suggestions too!" giggled Gladys Merriman.
"She's had it her own way too long. The fuss people
made about her at the bazaar was absurd."</p>

<p>"You weren't even asked to sing at the caf&eacute; chantant,
Gladys!" commented Alice O'Connor.</p>

<p>"There's been far too much of this favouritism
lately. It's time somebody took the thing up, and
others had their fair turn. I was speaking to Leonora
about it, and she quite agreed with me."</p>

<p>"Yes; Poppie gave a strong hint she'd like Leonora
pushed to the front rather than Gipsy."</p>

<p>"Poppie barely tolerates Gipsy."</p>

<p>"I agree with you there. She'd rejoice to see her
shelved."</p>

<p>"Well, look here, we've no time to stand gossiping.
If anything's to be done, we'd best go and canvass
among the kids."</p>

<p>It was exactly at this crisis that Meg Gordon returned
to school. She had been absent since the week
before Christmas, when her brother had developed
measles. She herself had caught the infection, and
one after another various brothers and sisters had
sickened with it, so that for about three months the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
whole family had been in quarantine. In her case
the old adage "absence makes the heart grow fonder"
was undoubtedly true. She came back more devoted
to Gipsy than ever, ready to hang upon her words, and
yield her somewhat the same fealty as a squire of
the Middle Ages rendered to the knight to whom, by
the laws of chivalry, he was bound. It was well for
Gipsy to have so firm an adherent, for her present
position in the school caused her to be greatly in need
of stanch friends.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>A Leader of the Opposition</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Gipsy</span> had called the General Meeting of the Magazine
department of the Guild because she honestly wished
her journal to be a representative organ for the whole
of the Lower School. A member of each Form was
on the Committee, but she thought suggestions would
probably be offered by others, and could then be discussed
and settled by popular vote. At four o'clock
on the Friday afternoon all the Juniors flocked to the
dressing-room, for there was a whisper abroad that
changes were in the wind, and that it behoved everybody
who had an interest in the subject to be present
and take sides. Dilys Fenton, as President of the
Guild, opened the proceedings with a few introductory
remarks; then Gipsy, as editress, read her report on
the Magazine.</div>

<p>"Members are invited to suggest any fresh features
that they consider would be advantageous for the
forthcoming summer term, and to offer any criticisms
on the past number." So she concluded.</p>

<p>"I think we may all declare ourselves perfectly
satisfied with this report," commented Dilys. "Our
editress has worked hard, and the <i>Journal</i> is a unique<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
success, which speaks for itself. Personally I can
suggest no improvements, but members are of course
invited to give their opinions."</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause, then Maude Helm
stood up.</p>

<p>"Our lady chairman and fellow members!" she
began airily, "I am glad to have this opportunity of
raising a protest against an abuse which I consider
is beginning to creep into our Guild, and which, unchecked,
may be liable to lead to very serious results.
You will remember that this Guild was founded in
consequence of the very unjust and unfair treatment
of the Lower School by the Seniors. This tyrannical
attitude of the monitresses had been long resented by
the Juniors, and though one new girl happened to
seize upon the matter and voice the discontent, it was
felt in many quarters that her action had been given
undue prominence, and that the real credit belonged
to those who had slowly and surely influenced the
general opinion. These members, though they stood
aside and waived their claims to gratitude, anxious
only for the welfare of the Lower School, feel strongly
that the whole conduct of the Magazine should be
now revised and placed upon a more representative
basis. I am not wishful to disparage the work of
one who has no doubt done her best for the <i>Journal</i>,
but I should like to suggest that there are others
among us equally capable of undertaking office, and,
if they had the chance, of running the affair with
possibly even greater success. It seems to me undesirable
for one person to take everything upon her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
shoulders, and as a question of fair play I beg to propose
that the editorship should be changed for each
issue of the Magazine, with a standing provision that
nobody be elected more than once in twelve months."</p>

<p>If a bombshell had suddenly exploded, some of the
girls could not have been more surprised. Dilys
Fenton stared at Maude as if marvelling at her amazing
impudence, Hetty Hancock flushed pink with annoyance,
and Meg Gordon's eyes sought the face of
her idol. A few of Maude's following clapped vigorously,
notably Leonora, and there was an echo of
support among some of the younger ones. Gipsy,
though she had been quite unprepared for such a
mutiny in camp, bore the attack with admirable coolness
and self-possession.</p>

<p>"I may perhaps be allowed to state," she remarked
calmly, "that any office which I hold at present was
not self-sought, but was given me as the result of the
general vote. To the members themselves, therefore,
I appeal, if they consider they've anything against
me."</p>

<p>"Maude's perfectly right!" interposed Gladys Merriman,
rising hastily. "This Magazine business has
been a 'one man show' all along. Nobody else has
had even a look-in. It's been 'Gipsy Latimer' from
beginning to end."</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh! Who's had a story in every number?"
cried a voice from the back.</p>

<p>"The editress oughtn't to be allowed to monopolize
the chief parts!" called out Alice O'Connor.</p>

<p>"She didn't!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>"How can you say so!"</p>

<p>"Go it, Alice! Pitch it strong! I'm with you!"</p>

<p>"Order! Order!" commanded Dilys. "This question
must be discussed from both sides. We'll take one at
a time, please."</p>

<p>"Maude! Let Maude speak, then!" shouted a band
of sympathizers from the opposition.</p>

<p>Maude, who had waxed warm, was only too ready
to speak, and seized upon the opportunity.</p>

<p>"I want to know," she demanded aggressively, "why
one girl expects to take the top seat in this school, and
dictate what's to be done all round? Newcomers used
to be kept in the background, but it seems all that's
changed now. However, if new girls are the fashion,
Leonora Parker's newer still, and why shouldn't she
be editress?"</p>

<p>"Because she couldn't!" piped somebody.</p>

<p>"Who's that says she couldn't?" shouted Gladys.</p>

<p>"Give her a chance to try!" called out Alice
O'Connor.</p>

<p>"Likely!"</p>

<p>"You want to try yourself, I suppose!"</p>

<p>"Look here, we don't want everything turned
topsy-turvy to suit a few like you."</p>

<p>"Order! Order!" cried Dilys again&mdash;a very necessary
command, for the members were growing excited,
and instead of stating their proposals in the orthodox,
conventional language which they prided themselves
upon always using at meetings, were descending to
personalities.</p>

<p>"Oh, do let me speak! I'll give it them hot!" begged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Hetty. But Meg Gordon had already caught the
President's eye, and began:</p>

<p>"If this is to be a representative meeting, it's time
some reply was made to Maude Helm's insinuations.
The main object of Maude's remarks seems to be to
cast a slur upon Gipsy Latimer, and to imply that
she's taken an unfair advantage in coming to the fore.
Every girl in this room knows that Gipsy Latimer
refused the Presidency of the Guild, and only accepted
the editorship because it was forced upon her. Did any
one of those who are so ready to run the Magazine
now it's started think of originating it? Of course
they didn't! It was Gipsy, and Gipsy alone, who
suggested the idea, drew up the plan, asked for contributions,
and made the thing the success it is. There isn't
another girl at Briarcroft who could have done it, or
if there is, why didn't she? Where's your gratitude?
Gipsy got us our own Guild, and the <i>Journal's</i> the
organ of the Guild. She's the only one who's really
qualified to be editress. I ask you, do you think
anyone else could do it equally well? No, you know
very well they couldn't, and wouldn't take the trouble
either!"</p>

<p>"Hear, hear!" shouted a number of voices, as Meg
stopped from sheer lack of breath.</p>

<p>"I thought this meeting was to be conducted in
strict order!" sneered Maude. "I made a proposal
a while ago, and instead of its being allowed to be
seconded and put to the vote, everybody began to
talk separately. I beg to propose again that the
editorship of the Magazine be changed each time,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
and nobody be eligible for office again within twelve
months."</p>

<p>"And I beg to second the proposal," cried Gladys.</p>

<p>"Those in favour, kindly signify!" said the President.</p>

<p>"Put it to the ballot!" suggested Alice O'Connor
eagerly.</p>

<p>"No, we'll have a show of hands," returned Hetty
grimly. "We want to know which among you are
answerable for this business. In all common sense,
how do you suppose a magazine can be run properly
with a different editress each time? But it's evidently
a question of Gipsy Latimer versus Maude Helm as
leader of the Lower School. Which will you choose,
girls?"</p>

<p>Several hands that were on the point of going up
wavered at that, and went down again. Maude was
not a general favourite, and though she had contrived
to raise a spirit of envy against Gipsy, nobody was
anxious to claim her as a leader.</p>

<p>"I suggested Leonora as editress," corrected Maude,
rising angrily. "Miss Poppleton herself proposed it!"</p>

<p>But at that there was a scornful laugh. Maude had
made a fatal mistake. Miss Poppleton's championship,
far from being a recommendation, was exactly the
reverse. The girls resented her interference in their
private concerns, and did not intend to allow her the
least voice in their councils.</p>

<p>"We don't want Poppie's pet, thanks!"</p>

<p>"She's not going to manage our Guild for us!"</p>

<p>"We can make our own choice!"</p>

<p>So few hands went up in favour of Maude's proposal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
that its rejection was obvious at once. Meg Gordon
started up immediately with a counter motion.</p>

<p>"I beg to propose that Gipsy Latimer continue to
be editress until the end of the summer term."</p>

<p>"And I beg to second that motion," agreed Lennie
Chapman heartily.</p>

<p>This time the hands went up in earnest, and there
was no doubt about the majority.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! Hurrah!" shouted Gipsy's supporters,
turning in much triumph upon the opposition as the
meeting broke up. Maude and her friends, finding the
point carried, had no more to say, and were obliged
to drop the subject. Leonora affected a sublime indifference.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I didn't want to be editress. I can't think
why they suggested it," she said, in her stolid, bored
fashion.</p>

<p>"To carry favour with Poppie, and spite Gipsy!"
declared Lennie Chapman. "I don't blame you: they
made you a cat's-paw, that's all."</p>

<p>"It's a victory for Gipsy, but I'm sorry it's happened
at all," fretted Hetty. "It's annoyed her dreadfully,
and I believe she's ready to throw the whole thing up
and resign office."</p>

<p>"That she can't and shan't and mustn't do! We
won't allow her!"</p>

<p>The struggle made a great sensation in the Upper
Fourth. Some of the girls openly twitted Maude
with her defeat, an unwise and ungenerous proceeding
which bore ill fruit. Maude was not a girl to let
bygones be bygones; she turned sulky, brooded over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
her grievances, and bore Gipsy a deeper grudge than
ever. She was determined that she would not let
the latter go entirely unscathed, and looked about
for some further opportunity of flinging a dart.</p>

<p>"I'll pay her out somehow&mdash;see if I don't!" she
grumbled to her chum Gladys. "Wish I could think
of some really good way!"</p>

<p>"I know!" cackled Gladys suddenly. "It's only
struck me this second. Oh! It's an inspiration!
No, I daren't tell you here, with all those kids about
eavesdropping. Come outside into the playground, and
I'll explain. Have you any used South African stamps
in your collection? Good! Then it's as simple as ABC."</p>

<p>"What are the Triumvirate up to?" asked Lennie
Chapman a few days later. "I'm absolutely certain
they've some mischief brewing."</p>

<p>"Do you mean Maude, Gladys, and Alice? I call
them Korah, Dathan, and Abiram," said Dilys.
"They're always hatching plots of some kind. I
suppose they've a fresh grievance against the Guild."</p>

<p>"I believe they'd like to start a rival magazine of
their own."</p>

<p>"Let them, then! There's no reason why they
shouldn't. We should have a chance to prove who's
the best editress. But I don't believe they'd take the
trouble when it came to the point. They only make
a fuss because they enjoy growling."</p>

<p>"I can stand growls, but Maude's apt to stick in
pins as well. I should like to find out what she's
evolving just at present."</p>

<p>Maude kept her secret well, however, and even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Lennie's watchful eyes could discover nothing beyond
the ordinary schoolgirl nonsense that generally went
on among the three chums. She decided that she
must have been mistaken after all.</p>

<p>March, with its boisterous winds, was passing fast
away, and an early spring was bringing on green buds,
and opening out venturous blossom on pear and plum
trees. It was the first time Gipsy had seen an English
spring, and she enjoyed the experience. The thrushes
and blackbirds which carolled all day in the Briarcroft
garden especially appealed to her.</p>

<p>"They're little plain birds to look at, but they just
sing their hearts out," she said. "I learnt Browning's
piece about the thrush when I was at school in Australia,
and I always wanted to hear a real English one.
I don't wonder he was enthusiastic about it."</p>

<p>March had arrived like the traditional lion, but went
out like the orthodox lamb, and the 1st of April was
ushered in by most appropriate showers. The time-honoured
festival was kept up in rather a languid
fashion at Briarcroft. The Upper School discountenanced
it as childish and foolish, but a few of the
Juniors indulged in jokes at one another's expense.
These were mostly confined to the First and Second
Forms, and the Upper Fourth as a rule scorned them
equally with the Seniors.</p>

<p>On this particular morning the girls had just taken
their places in their classroom, and were waiting for
Miss White, when Maude handed Gipsy a letter, with
the casual enquiry: "I say, Yankee Doodle, is this
meant for you?" It was a thin foreign envelope, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
bore a South African stamp, and it was addressed to
"Miss Latimer, Briarcroft Hall, Greyfield, England".
Gipsy glanced at it at first idly, then seized upon it
as a starving man clutches at food. Her heart was
beating and throbbing wildly, and her shaking, trembling
fingers could scarcely tear it open. Was it at
last the news for which she had been yearning, craving,
sickening for so many weary, weary months? It
was not her father's writing, but it might possibly
contain tidings of him. She could scarcely control
her violent excitement; her cheeks were white, her
lips were quivering, and she drew her breath with
little, short, painful jerks. In frantic anticipation she
dragged the letter from its envelope, and unfolded it.
It was only a single sheet of foreign paper, and it bore
but one sentence:</p>

<div class='center'>
"First of April; nicely sold!"<br />
</div>

<p>For a moment Gipsy gazed at the words without
really comprehending their meaning. Then it dawned
upon her that she was the victim of a most cruel hoax.
The revulsion of feeling was so great, and the disappointment
so intense, that she gave a little, sharp,
bitter cry, and, leaning forward over her desk, buried
her head in her arms, and sobbed audibly.</p>

<p>"What is it, Gipsy? What's the matter?" enquired
her neighbours.</p>

<p>"Read it! Oh, how could anybody?" choked Gipsy.</p>

<p>Hetty Hancock seized upon the sheet, which had
fallen to the floor, and after one brief glance at its
contents turned upon Maude with blazing eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>"I never thought much of you, Maude Helm, but I
didn't believe even you could have invented such a
detestably mean, dastardly trick as this. You deserve
to be boycotted by every decent girl in the school."</p>

<p>"It was only a joke," blustered Maude. "Everyone
expects to be taken in to-day."</p>

<p>"It's a wicked, heartless joke&mdash;the cruellest thing
you could have thought of&mdash;and you knew it, and
did it on purpose!"</p>

<p>"How could you, Maude? It's hateful!" came in a
chorus from the other girls. "We'll tell Miss White!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sure it's not so dreadful, and it was
Gladys who thought of it, too!" protested Maude,
finding popular opinion against her.</p>

<p>"Don't try and put it off on Gladys, though one of
you is as bad as the other. Girls, I'm not going to
speak to Maude Helm or Gladys Merriman for a
week, and I hope nobody else will either!" thundered
Hetty.</p>

<p>Lennie Chapman and Meg Gordon were trying to
comfort Gipsy, and make her take heart of grace
again, but she had suffered a severe shock, and controlled
herself with difficulty. She sat up, however,
as Miss White came into the room.</p>

<p>"Don't tell her!" she whispered huskily. "What's
the use? It would only make a fuss, and I hate
fusses. The thing's over now, and I'd rather try and
forget it. Maude needn't be proud of such a poor
joke!"</p>

<p>"What a stoic you are!" returned Meg admiringly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>Mountaineering</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Easter</span> was drawing very near, and the school was to
break up for more than three weeks. Gipsy, to her
intense delight, had been asked to spend the holidays
with the Gordons, and Miss Poppleton had graciously
allowed her to accept the invitation.</div>

<p>"We had meant to ask you for Christmas," said
Meg, "and Mother had even got as far as writing a
letter to Poppie; then Billy broke out in spots, and the
doctor said we might all have taken the infection, and
we must stop in quarantine. It was a horrible nuisance.
I felt so savage! But we couldn't invite you
to come and share measles! We're all looking forward
most tremendously to your visit. I'm so excited I can
hardly wait till the end of the term!"</p>

<p>After six months spent entirely at Briarcroft, Gipsy
felt that the idea of a change was most welcome and
exhilarating. She liked Meg, and wanted to see her
home surroundings. The two younger sisters, Eppie
and Molly, she knew already, as they were in the
Lower Third and Second Forms, and she had always
set them down, in school parlance, as "jolly kids".
The rest of the family she hoped would prove equally
interesting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>Poor Gipsy heaved many a sigh as she packed her
box. Her outfit seemed such a very shabby one with
which to go a-visiting, and she hoped Mrs. Gordon
would not feel ashamed of her guest. At the last
moment Miss Edith, looking rather guilty and self-conscious,
popped hastily into the bedroom and thrust
a small parcel into her hand.</p>

<p>"It's a little present, Gipsy dear," she said nervously,
"just some new hair ribbons and a pair of gloves and
a tie. You've no need to tell Miss Poppleton or anybody
that I gave them to you. Don't thank me&mdash;I'd
rather you didn't! I do hope you'll enjoy yourself,
you poor child!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Edie! If a letter should happen to come
for me from South Africa while I'm away, you'd send
it on, wouldn't you?" asked Gipsy wistfully.</p>

<p>"I'd bring it myself, at once," returned Miss
Edith, as she scuttled out of the room in a desperate
hurry.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gordon sent a cab to Briarcroft on breaking-up
day, and when Gipsy's box had been placed on the top,
Meg, Eppie, and Molly bore away their guest with
great rejoicing. The Gordons lived at an old-fashioned
house about a mile from the school. It seemed quite
in the country, with fields all round, and had an orchard
and large garden, a pond, an asphalted tennis
court for wet weather, as well as a grass one, and a
croquet lawn.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gordon welcomed Gipsy most kindly, and at
once made her feel at home, and the remainder of
the family were introduced by degrees. Mr. Gordon,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
a jovial, genial man, greeted her with a humorous
twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>"So this is Meg's idol! Glad to see you, my dear!"
he remarked. "If you can cure Meg of standing on
one leg and puckering up her mouth when she talks,
I'll be grateful. She seems disposed to listen to you
in preference to anyone here, so please act mentor."</p>

<p>"Oh, Dad! Don't be naughty!" shrieked Meg.
"What will Gipsy think of you?"</p>

<p>"A favourable opinion, I trust," laughed Mr. Gordon,
as he vanished into his own particular sanctum.</p>

<p>Donald, Meg's elder brother, seemed disposed to be
friendly; but Billy, the twelve-year-old offender who
had started the family with measles, was afflicted with
shyness, and preferred to inspect the visitor from afar
until he grew accustomed to her presence. Rob, the
youngest, a roguish laddie of six, fell openly in love
with Gipsy at first sight, and prepared to monopolize
her company to an extent that Meg would by no means
allow.</p>

<p>"She's my friend, and hasn't come here to play with
little boys. Run away to the nursery, and leave us
alone!" she commanded, enforcing her words by a
process of summary ejection, regardless of all wails.</p>

<p>Gipsy had further to form an acquaintance with
two dogs, three cats, a dormouse, and a tame starling,
before she was considered intimate with the whole
household, but after that she felt thoroughly at home.</p>

<p>The Gordons were a particularly jolly, merry, happy-go-lucky
set of young people, and they made their
guest so entirely welcome that at the end of a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
days she might have known them all for years. Even
the bashful Billy soon ceased turning crimson whenever
he spoke to her, while Eppie and Molly disputed
fiercely over the honour of sitting next to her at tea.
It happened to be a fine Easter, so outdoor occupations
were in full swing. Gipsy was an ardent tennis player,
and revelled in golf also. She and Meg and Donald
made many cycling excursions, for the neighbourhood
was pretty and the roads were good. With packets
of sandwiches tied to their handlebars they would
start off for a whole day's ride, to explore some ruined
abbey or ancient castle, or to get a picturesque view
of the fells. Donald, who was keen on collecting
birds' eggs, would often stop the party, to hunt for
nests in the hedges or banks; while Meg, whose hobby
at present was wild flowers, kept a watchful eye for
any fresh specimens that she might find growing by
the roadside.</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon was an enthusiastic member of an
Alpine Club, and he would sometimes take the elder
and more reliable members of his family on to the
fells for mountaineering practice. Many of the rocks
afforded excellent training for Switzerland, without
involving any special danger. These climbs were
something quite new for Gipsy, and an immense delight.
She was very fearless, and had a steady head,
so she proved an apt pupil. Mr. Gordon would show
her exactly how she must place her feet and hold
herself so as to take advantage of the tiniest and
narrowest ledges of rock, and she much enjoyed the
excitement of accomplishing, under his guidance, what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
would have appeared to her impossible performances
without his skilled advice. Meg and Donald had
already received some training, and when Gipsy was
sufficiently advanced to be able to keep up with them,
Mr. Gordon allowed them all three to venture with
him on a more difficult ascent, linked together with
one of his Alpine ropes. Gipsy was proud indeed as
she stood at the top of a jagged crag and waved her
hand to Billy, who was taking a snapshot of the party
from below.</p>

<p>Poor Billy was liable to fits of dizziness since his
attack of measles, and was not allowed any real climbing,
so he consoled himself by following the others
about with a Brownie camera, and photographing
them in the most dangerous-looking positions that
he could catch.</p>

<p>"Billy must do some extra prints, and you could
put them in the Magazine," suggested Meg to Gipsy.
"You could write an article on 'Mountaineering in
Cumberland'. It would be grand, and would make
Maude Helm gnash her teeth with envy."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she's been doing something even more
exciting to astonish us with," laughed Gipsy. "I wish
we could have climbed a real mountain, like Skiddaw."</p>

<p>"Yes, there'd be some credit in that," commented
Donald thoughtfully. He said no more at the moment,
but a few days afterwards, when the three
young people had set out on another cycling expedition,
he had an enterprising plan to unfold.</p>

<p>"I vote we ride as far as Ribblethwaite, leave
our machines there, and then climb Hawes Fell," he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
announced. "We've started so early we'd have heaps
and loads of time. It would be a thing worth doing!
I didn't broach the idea at home because I knew the
Mater'd be in such a state of mind, and think we were
going to break our necks. It will be time enough to
tell about it when we come back. Are you two game
to go?"</p>

<p>"Rather!" exclaimed both the girls rapturously.</p>

<p>Gipsy, with her Colonial bringing up and independent
American ideas, did not realize any necessity to
ask permission for such an expedition. She had been
in far wilder places, and considered the Cumberland
fells civilized ground compared with portions of the
Rockies and certain mountainous tracts of New Zealand
with which she was familiar.</p>

<p>If Meg had any qualms of conscience she contrived
to quiet them with the comforting assurance: "Dad
would have taken us if he hadn't been busy at his
office, and we can manage so well ourselves now, we
can get on all right without him."</p>

<p>Ribblethwaite was a pretty little village about six
miles away, a typical north-country hamlet with its
stone cottages, with mullioned windows and flagged
stone roofs, its grey turreted church tower, and its
quick-flowing, brawling river. It was well wooded,
but it stood high, and at this early season of the year
the trees were still bare, and only a few green buds
showed here and there on the hedges. The gardens
were full of golden daffodils and clumps of opening
polyanthus; but primroses&mdash;which had long been in
blossom in the sheltered garden at Briarcroft&mdash;were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
here only venturing into bud. As the inn looked clean
and attractive, the three decided to leave their bicycles
there, and to have a lunch of ham and eggs and coffee
before setting out on their climb.</p>

<p>"Then we can take our sandwiches with us. We're
sure to want them up there," said Donald.</p>

<p>"Yes; best to fortify ourselves thoroughly before we
start," agreed Meg.</p>

<p>"Billy'll be fearfully sick when he hears where
we've been," said Gipsy.</p>

<p>"Poor old Billy-ho! Yes, he'd have liked to follow
us with his camera; but he's not quite up to tackling
Hawes Fell just at present," agreed Meg.</p>

<p>The inn was a delightfully quaint, old-fashioned,
primitive little place, such as is not often found in
these days of modern improvements. Gipsy, who had
had no opportunity before of seeing English country
life, was enchanted with its sanded floor, its oak
dresser with rows of willow-pattern plates, its pewter
mugs and dishes, and the great brass preserving-pan
that was set in the ingle-nook. She admired the oak
beams of the ceiling, the rows of plant pots in the
long mullioned window, the settle drawn up by the
big fireplace, and the glass cases of stuffed pike and
game birds that adorned the walls.</p>

<p>The lunch was a great success&mdash;a smoking dish of
fried ham and eggs, home-made bread and farmhouse
butter, thin oatcakes and moorland honey, and coffee,
with thick yellow cream to pour into it.</p>

<p>"Beats school, doesn't it?" said Donald, with a
chuckle of enjoyment, as he helped himself to a third<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
serving of honey. "I say, though, we shan't have to
stop too long feasting here if we mean to get to the
top of Hawes Fell. It's a jolly good step, I can tell
you."</p>

<p>"We're ready!" returned Meg smartly. "We were
only waiting for you to finish gormandizing."</p>

<p>"Thanks for the compliment! One doesn't get the
chance of heather honey every day, and I've a remarkably
sweet tooth. Anything in the way of jam or
preserves left near me invariably vanishes."</p>

<p>The way up the fell lay first over the old stone
bridge that spanned the river, then across fields, and
by a narrow footpath leading up a steep and thickly-wooded
hillside. Though the trees were still in their
winter garb they were none the less lovely for that;
the lack of foliage revealed the delicate tracery of
their boughs and the beauty of their straight stems,
which, in one or two terraced glades, were like the
columns and shafts of some great cathedral. The sun
shining down the glen gave a soft purplish tint to the
bare twigs, and brought out in bolder contrast the
deep dark green of the innumerable masses of ivy
that had utterly taken possession of and choked some
of the trees supporting them.</p>

<p>"Isn't it glorious? I always say our fells need a
great deal of beating," said Meg, who was an enthusiast
over her native county. "I don't believe there's
a wood equal to this anywhere!" and she began to
sing the old north-country ditty:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"A north-countree maid<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Up to London had strayed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Although with her nature it did not agree.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">She wept and she sighed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And she bitterly cried:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">'I wish once again in the north I could be!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Oh! the oak and the ash and the bonny ivy tree,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">They all grow so green in the north countree!'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Don't know whether you'll get Gipsy to agree with
you; she ought to be a dab critic of scenery by now,"
grunted Donald.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's lovely!" said Gipsy, who was enjoying
herself immensely. "Of course it's quite, quite different
from America, or Australia, or South Africa. It's
smaller, but it's prettier in its own way. It looks
much more cultivated."</p>

<p>"Ah! wait till you get right out on the moor at the
top. You won't insult that by calling it cultivated."</p>

<p>The woods were soon left behind, and the pathway
led ever upwards, first through a tangle of heather
and bilberry and gorse; then, higher still, over short,
fine, slippery tracts of grass. They were reaching the
upper region of the fell, where the hard rock cropped
out into great splintered crags, weathered by countless
winter storms, and where no bushes or softer
herbage could face the struggle for existence. So far
the walk had been comparatively easy, but now the
footpath had disappeared, and they were obliged to
trust to their knowledge of mountaineering. The top
still towered above them a very long way off, and they
calculated it would need a two hours' climb before
they could reach the particular crag that marked the
extreme summit.</p>

<p>Donald assumed the leadership of the party, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
scanning the mountainside with what he called an
Alpine eye, decided which would be their best course
to pursue. There were several steep precipices and
awkward places that must be avoided, for though
they were all quite ready to try their skill at scaling
rocks, it seemed no use to waste unnecessary time
over performing difficult feats.</p>

<p>"I expect that last crag will give us enough practice
in that," remarked Donald. "I've brought a rope with
me in case we want it&mdash;got it wound round and round
my waist under my coat."</p>

<p>"Oh, that explains why you look so stout to-day!"
laughed Meg. "I should think it's pretty uncomfortable."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it! It keeps me warm. I call it
jolly cold up here."</p>

<p>"I believe we've reached the Arctic zone!" agreed
Gipsy.</p>

<p>The air had undoubtedly grown colder with every
hundred feet of their ascent. The sunshine had disappeared,
grey clouds had gathered, and feathery flakes
of snow began to fall lightly. The grass was soon
covered with a thin white coating which gave a delightfully
Alpine aspect to the scene. The prospect was
glorious&mdash;the sharp, splintered, snow-crested crags
stood out in bold relief against the neutral-tinted sky,
and the long stretches of moor below them looked soft
and blurred masses of whiteness.</p>

<p>"We can find our way home by our footsteps in the
snow!" said Gipsy, drawing long breaths of the pure,
exhilarating air.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder if we ought to turn back," said Meg,
rather doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Turn back!" exclaimed Donald. "You don't mean
to say you want to turn tail now, Meg? Why, we're
just getting to the exciting part!"</p>

<p>"I was only thinking of the snow."</p>

<p>"Why, that makes it all the more like Switzerland!
You don't suppose Dad turns back at the snowline
when he's doing a climb? We're in luck to have the
chance of a little snow. I wish there'd been a keen
frost, and we could have tried an ice axe somewhere.
Pluck up your courage, Meg! You'll never do the
Matterhorn if you shirk Hawes Fell!"</p>

<p>Thus encouraged Meg said no more, though she had
her private doubts about the wisdom of proceeding
farther. It is an unpleasant task to be a drag on
other people's amusement, and both Donald and Gipsy
were very keen on making the ascent. So they scrambled
onward and upward, slipping often on the rapidly
freezing rocks, helping each other over difficult places,
sighing for nailed boots and alpenstocks, but laughing
and enjoying the fun of the adventure.</p>

<p>To climb to the summit certainly taxed all their
strength. The mountain seemed to heave before them
in a succession of huge boulders, and as each one was
scaled another appeared beyond it. At length they
reached a piled confusion of rocks, where a little cairn
had been built of small stones and loose pieces of
shale.</p>

<p>"There we are! The very place!" shouted Donald.
"I knew we'd find it if we pegged along. Now, can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
you girls tackle this last bit? Wouldn't you like to
use the rope?"</p>

<p>The final piece of crag was slippery enough to
justify Donald's offer, and as he seemed particularly
anxious not to have brought his rope in vain, the
others consented to give it a trial. With its aid the
difficult bit was accomplished fairly easily, and the
three were soon standing in triumph by the cairn,
hurrahing and waving their handkerchiefs with much
excitement.</p>

<p>"I'm going to eat my sandwiches here; I'm fagged
out," declared Gipsy, sitting down on a stone and
suddenly realizing that she was tired and hungry.</p>

<p>The others followed suit, very ready for a rest and
a picnic. It was a long time since their lunch at the
inn, and the frosty air had given them keen appetites.
It was too cold to sit still, however, for more than five
or ten minutes; a bitter wind had sprung up, and the
snow, which had only fallen very lightly before, began
to come down in thicker and heavier flakes.</p>

<p>"We'd better be going, or we shan't be able to find
our way," worried Meg anxiously.</p>

<p>"Right-o! only we must each add a stone to the
cairn first," replied Donald. "I've a pencil here, and
we'll write our names on them as proof conclusive
that we've been, in case anybody doubts our word
afterwards."</p>

<p>So "Gipsy Latimer", "Margaret Gordon", and
"Donald Alexander Gordon" were duly inscribed on
smooth pieces of shale and placed as evidence on the
top of the pile, after which ceremony the three began<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
their descent with something of the feeling of Arctic
explorers who had reached the Pole.</p>

<p>It was indeed high time to return. Clouds were
blowing up fast, and with the thickening snow began
rapidly to obscure the view. The trio went very cautiously,
trying to remember various landmarks which
they had noticed on the way up. Gipsy's idea of retracing
their footsteps in the snow soon proved futile,
for already all tracks were obliterated. It was impossible
to see far in front of them, and but for the
compass that hung on Donald's watch-chain they
would have had no notion of where they were going.</p>

<p>"We must keep due west, and look out sharp for
precipices. Don't let us get separated on any account.
Hadn't we better use the rope again?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe we're anywhere near the way we
came up. I don't recognize these rocks in the least,"
said Meg.</p>

<p>"Never mind, if we get down somewhere to civilization,"
returned Gipsy.</p>

<p>"Yes, but we don't want to be five miles away from
our bicycles!"</p>

<p>"We're all right!" exclaimed Donald jubilantly.
"Here's the piece of white quartz we were sitting on,
I'm sure. Yes!" (grubbing about under the snow)
"I'm right, for here's a scrap of the silver paper from
the chocolate we were eating. Hurrah! I'm going
to set up for an Alpine guide!"</p>

<p>The snow was clearing considerably as they got
farther down the mountainside, and after a while
they were able to recognize various points of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
landscape, and realized that Donald's compass and
instinct for locality had led them correctly.</p>

<p>"It was a narrow squeak, though," confessed Meg.
"I don't mind telling you now that I thought we
should have to stay up there all night! It's getting
fearfully late&mdash;we must sprint back when we reach
our machines."</p>

<p>"We'll have some hot tea at the inn first," declared
Donald. "You girls will never sprint six miles without!"</p>

<p>Very tired, but exceedingly proud of themselves, the
mountaineers reached home at half-past eight, to find
Mr. and Mrs. Gordon looking out anxiously for their
return.</p>

<p>"You young scamps! I'd no idea you were going
climbing on your own!" said Mr. Gordon. "I'd have
forbidden it if I'd known. Hawes Fell is a nasty
little bit at the finish."</p>

<p>"But we did it, Dad!" cried Meg excitedly. "We
put our feet on all the right ledges, just as you taught
us. Oh! Don't you think I'm old enough to go to
Switzerland with you next summer, and try some
real ice work? You promised you'd take me when
I was fifteen!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>A School Mystery</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">After</span> the delightful three weeks spent with the
Gordons, Gipsy felt that so pleasant an experience of
English home life made it doubly difficult to return
to Briarcroft. No news of her father had arrived
during her absence, and she was received with black
looks by Miss Poppleton. She had begun to dread,
with a shrinking, nervous horror, those futile interviews
with the Principal&mdash;interviews in which she
could only state again how little she knew, and listen
to fresh reproaches. She tried to brace herself for
the ordeal when ordered to the study, but her heart
failed her as she tapped at the door, and she entered
with something of the apprehension of a victim of the
Inquisition facing the torture chamber. She advanced
hesitatingly towards the Principal's desk, and stood
without speaking, a forlorn enough little figure to
have excited compassion in the most mercenary heart.
Miss Poppleton glanced at her furtively, and looked
away again. She had made up her mind not to allow
herself to be worked upon by her feelings, and meant
to speak plainly.</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 312px;">
<img src="images/gs04.jpg" width="312" height="500" alt="AN INTERVIEW WITH MISS POPPLETON" title="" />
<span class="caption">AN INTERVIEW WITH MISS POPPLETON</span>
</div>

<p>"It's no use mincing matters, Gipsy!" she began,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
blustering a little to hide her own sense of uneasiness.
"Here we are at the beginning of another term, and
things are exactly the same as they were at Christmas.
Not a word from your father, or from your New
Zealand relations either. It's plain enough they mean
to abandon you! Now, I want you to understand that
I can't be responsible for you. You must think again.
Are there absolutely no relations or friends to whom
you can apply?"</p>

<p>Gipsy sighed as she gave the same old answer. Had
she been possessed of any information, how gladly
would she have supplied it!</p>

<p>"I can't keep a school for philanthropy," frowned
Miss Poppleton. "I'm afraid your father is an adventurer
pure and simple. He's left you on my
hands, and gone off, who knows where? I'll let you
have one more term here, just on the chance of his
turning up; but if we've heard nothing by the summer
holidays, then I shall be obliged to apply to the Emigration
Society, and send you out to New Zealand.
Your relatives there would be forced, at least, to
support you, though I suppose I shall have to write
down your fees here as bad debts. In the meantime
you must make yourself as useful as you can, out of
school hours. You might help Miss Edith with the
mending, and look after No. 1 dormitory. I can't
afford to keep you here on the same footing as an
ordinary pupil. It's an unpleasant business from beginning
to end."</p>

<p>Very unpleasant, thought poor Gipsy, as she availed
herself of permission to go. Her proud spirit could
not bear her position of sufferance in the school, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
she would almost have preferred to be handed over to
the Emigration Society, and deported to New Zealand.
That her father should be called an adventurer seemed
the cruellest cut of all. The reason for his long silence
she could not fathom, but she was positive he would
never abandon her, and her faith in him did not waver.
Some day, if he were still alive, she knew he would
come to claim her; and in the meantime, though life
was dark, for the sake of her own self-respect she
must show a brave front. Gipsy certainly needed all
the courage and fortitude of which she was possessed.</p>

<p>If last term had been hard, the present term was
harder still. Miss Poppleton's hint about making her
useful was no idle remark, as she soon found to her
cost. Instead of joining the other girls at tennis and
croquet in her play hours, she was expected to sit in
the linen room, darning stockings and hemming dusters,
or mending damaged garments. She was made into a
kind of attendant for the little ones who slept in No. 1
dormitory, and was responsible for brushing their hair,
seeing that they had their baths, putting away their
clothes, and keeping their room in order. It was a
recognized thing that she was to be at the beck and
call of all the mistresses, to run errands, take messages,
fetch articles wanted, and do innumerable little "odd
jobs" about the house.</p>

<p>She was willing enough thus to help to earn her
salt, but the unfortunate part was that the extra
work made serious inroads upon her time. Her new
dormitory duties took a large slice out of each
evening, and no allowances were made in class for
the fact that her hours of preparation were curtailed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
She resented the injustice of being reproached for
badly learnt lessons, when she had been busy the
night before washing the hair of her little charges,
copying some notes for Miss Lindsay, sorting music,
filling inkpots, and stitching fresh braid on Miss Poppleton's
skirt. The mistresses did not really mean to
impose upon Gipsy, but having been told to make the
girl of use, it was so easy to hand over all the tiresome
extra things for her to do, and completely to
forget that an accumulation of trifles may make a
large sum. It never struck anybody that Gipsy's legs
could grow weary with constantly running up and
down stairs, or that she preferred tennis to darning
and croquet to brushing children's coats; all were
supremely busy with their own concerns; and though
Miss Edith sometimes noticed that she looked tired,
loyalty to Miss Poppleton forbade the least interference.
So Gipsy plodded away, with a grim determination
to do her best, and not to give in under
any circumstances whatsoever. She was much too
proud to make complaints to her friends, even if they
could have helped her, and met their compassion for
her non-appearance at the tennis courts with an assumption
of indifference.</p>

<p>"I can't get at Gipsy nowadays!" said Hetty Hancock
to Dilys Fenton. "She seems quite changed this
term, since Poppie's made her into a kind of pupil
teacher. It's as if there were a barrier suddenly set
up between us."</p>

<p>"So there is&mdash;a barrier of her own making," sighed
Dilys. "I've tried to get across it myself, and I can't.
The fact is, Gipsy's about the proudest girl in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
school, and she's eating her heart out at finding herself
in this queer position. She's neither exactly a pupil,
nor a teacher, nor a monitress, nor anything: indeed,
Poppie treats her more as a servant; sometimes she
absolutely wipes her boots on her! Gipsy's like a
princess sold into slavery! She's taking it hardly,
but she won't let it crush her spirit. I think she
feels so sore, she can't even bear our sympathy."</p>

<p>"I wish we could do something," groaned Hetty.</p>

<p>"Nothing would be of any use, unless you could
find her father. I'm afraid, myself, he must be dead."</p>

<p>"She's fighting a battle against fearful odds," said
Hetty, shaking her head. "She's keeping her self-respect
when most girls would have given way utterly.
I suppose there's nothing to be done but just look on
and admire her pluck. I should like to speak my
mind to Poppie sometimes!"</p>

<p>"You'd do Gipsy no good, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"I wonder Miss Edith doesn't stand up more for
her."</p>

<p>"Miss Edith! She's a jellyfish&mdash;a crushed worm&mdash;a
mere serf and vassal! She's frightened to death of
her sister, in my opinion, and hardly dare call her
soul her own. She'd be nice enough to Gipsy if
Poppie'd let her."</p>

<p>"Look here! I hope Gipsy's going to the Fourth
Form picnic next week."</p>

<p>"Gracious! So do I. I hadn't thought of it. She
never does go to anything now that needs paying for.
Oh, but she must! We can't have her left out of it.
Let's beard Poppie boldly in her den, offer to pay
Gipsy's share in private, and beg for her to come."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm game if you are, and ready to go halves."</p>

<p>The Upper and Lower Fourth Forms always joined
in an excursion, which was invariably held on the
first Saturday in June. They went, under the care
of Miss White, to visit some place of interest in the
neighbourhood, and the journey was made either by
train or in hired wagonettes. Tea was provided at
a farmhouse or hotel, and counting the price of admission
to ruins and tips to guides, the little jaunt
generally worked out at about three or four shillings
per head. All the other Forms in the school had similar
picnics: the Fifth and Sixth invariably combined,
as did the First and Second; and the Third, which like
the Fourth consisted of Upper and Lower divisions,
was large enough to have its own outing. To miss
the annual excursion would be felt by any girl as a
terrible omission, almost as bad as missing the prize-giving
or the Christmas soir&eacute;e.</p>

<p>Hetty and Dilys hastened therefore to Miss Poppleton's
study, to make quite sure that on such an important
occasion Gipsy should not be left behind.
They stated their case with considerable eagerness
and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"We'd pay all Gipsy's share between us, only, please,
we'd rather she didn't know anything about that part
of it," ended Dilys, who did the most of the talking.</p>

<p>Miss Poppleton received the suggestion with a coldness
that was particularly damping.</p>

<p>"I can't decide anything at present," she said briefly.
"I doubt if Gipsy can be spared. Her new duties
keep her occupied in looking after the little ones, and
Saturday is a busy day. No, Dilys, I can't promise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Gipsy must remember it is impossible for her to have
everything the same as other girls, and she must not
expect it."</p>

<p>"Oh, she didn't ask us to ask you! She doesn't
know anything about it. It was our idea entirely,"
put in Hetty hastily.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear it," returned Miss Poppleton
dryly, and dismissed the girls without further ceremony.</p>

<p>"I don't believe she means to let her go," declared
Dilys indignantly, as they walked down the passage.
"Poppie's taken an absolute spite against Gipsy lately.
But I'll be even with her! I've got an idea. Let's
make the picnic a Guild affair, and persuade all the
Lower School to join together and do the same excursion
on the same day. Then Gipsy'd be bound to go,
to help to look after those kids! Besides, she's the
Secretary."</p>

<p>"Stunning! I believe we shall compass it. Only
don't say what's our object, or Maude Helm or somebody
will be putting a spoke in our wheel perhaps.
We'll call a meeting of the Guild and propose it. You
bring it up, and I'll second it."</p>

<p>Dilys's and Hetty's suggestion was very well received
by the Guild. The idea of a big united picnic
sounded attractive, so the motion was carried unanimously.
It was of course necessary to refer the
matter to Miss Poppleton and the mistresses, but they
were not likely to offer objections to a scheme favoured
by the whole of the Lower School. It would indeed
be easier for the mistresses to co-operate than for each
to take charge of a separate Form. It was decided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
to ask permission for the excursion to be regarded
as the annual treat of the Guild, and particularly to
request that all officers should be present and wear
their badges.</p>

<p>"Done Poppie for once, I believe!" triumphed Dilys.
"She can't have the cheek to keep our Secretary at
home. The Guild would mutiny."</p>

<p>"She's made such a fuss of the Guild, she's bound to
allow us some latitude," agreed Hetty.</p>

<p>"Then on Saturday week Gipsy shall get one treat,
if she doesn't get another all this term."</p>

<p>But before Saturday week something happened.</p>

<p>Among the various rules of Briarcroft, one of the
strictest was that which forbade any boarders to go
outside the grounds without first obtaining special
permission from Miss Poppleton. The day girls at
the school wore the regulation sailor hat with a plain
band of navy-blue ribbon, but the boarders, to distinguish
them from the others, had a navy band with
a white stripe in it. They were extremely proud of
these stripes, which they regarded as a badge of
superiority, similar to the gold tassels which, many
years ago, were worn by the sons of the nobility on
their college caps at Oxford. The hats were of course
very well known in the neighbourhood, and nobody
who lived anywhere near the school could possibly
mistake the Briarcroft "sailor".</p>

<p>Now it came to Miss Poppleton's ears, through the
medium of one of those malicious little birds who have
a reputation for carrying inconvenient pieces of information,
that on several evenings, just at dusk, a girl
who wore a boarder's hat had been seen to leave the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
garden and hurry up the road, returning about five
minutes later to dodge with great caution inside the
gate. Such a proceeding was manifestly irregular and
highly improper. Miss Poppleton, at first indignant at
the very idea that one of her pupils could be guilty of
so great an indiscretion, nevertheless felt it her solemn
duty to investigate the matter thoroughly, and either
expose the offender or deny the imputation. She was
the more particularly annoyed because the hint came
from a quarter which, if not absolutely hostile, was
inclined to regard her establishment as old-fashioned,
and to air the notion that there was room for another
high-class ladies' school in Greyfield. In the face of
such reports, the scandal must be instantly suppressed.
She arranged, therefore, that a careful watch should
be kept on the school, and if anyone were seen going
out or returning in a surreptitious and unorthodox
fashion, the occurrence must be immediately reported,
so that she could act promptly and catch the delinquent.
She said nothing about the affair to the girls,
as she did not wish to put them on their guard,
but Miss Edith and the mistresses were instructed
to use extreme vigilance.</p>

<p>One of the manifold duties that had lately been
heaped upon Gipsy's shoulders was the task of sorting
the stockings that came from the wash, and putting
in a pile those that required darning. She had been
very busy one evening with this rather uncongenial
occupation, and had barely finished the necessary
counting and arranging, when the bell rang for preparation.
During the last few days Miss Lindsay had
insisted upon Gipsy joining the others and learning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
her lessons as usual, and had scolded her if she were
absent, even on an errand for another mistress.
It was most unreasonable to reproach her for what
was seldom her own fault; but knowing that Miss
Lindsay would expect her to be in her place, she
hastily put the stockings away, and fled to fetch her
books.</p>

<p>Preparation was being held in the Juniors' room,
and the girls were sitting on forms round the long
table. Gipsy, scuttling in just in time to avoid the
mistress's censure, took a seat between Hetty Hancock
and Lennie Chapman, and, opening her French
grammar, began to write an exercise. All the Junior
boarders were at work with the exception of Dilys
Fenton, Leonora Parker, and Barbara Kendrick,
who were practising, for the girls had to take turns
to use the pianos, according to a carefully arranged
monthly music list. Gipsy plodded on with her
exercise, and had arrived at sentence No. 9 when
suddenly a horrible thought struck her. It had been
rather dark in the linen room, and in order to examine
the stockings better, she had switched on the electric
light. She was almost certain that in her hurry she
had forgotten to turn it off again. Leaving on the
electric light unnecessarily was one of Gipsy's worst
crimes, a negligence for which Miss Poppleton had
often rebuked her severely. If the Principal were to
walk past the linen room she would certainly enquire
who had been there last, and would administer a
scolding, at the prospect of which Gipsy shivered.</p>

<p>She wondered if she dared ask Miss Lindsay to
allow her to go and ascertain. It was a mild, wet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
evening, much darker than usual, and the mistress sat
reading close by the window, so as to catch the advantage
of the fading light. Her profile, rather stern
in its outline, did not look particularly encouraging,
and Gipsy sighed, knowing that her request would
probably be met by a prompt refusal. What was she
to do? It was a question of braving either Miss
Lindsay's or Miss Poppleton's wrath&mdash;perhaps both.
'Twixt two fires she hesitated, then an idea occurred
to her. If she could get out of the room and return
to her place without the governess discovering her
absence, all would be well. Miss Lindsay seemed
absorbed in her book, and as long as her pupils kept
quietly at work she took no particular notice of them.
As before stated, she was seated close to the window,
while the girls were placed round a long table, the end
of which, nearest to the open door, was unoccupied.
Gipsy hastily scribbled on a scrap of paper: "I'm
going to do a bolt&mdash;don't give me away!" and, with
her finger on her lips for silence, showed it to her two
neighbours, Lennie and Hetty. Then very quietly
and cautiously she dropped from the form, and began
to creep underneath the table in the direction of the
open door. Lennie and Hetty, after a glance at the
paper, comprehended her scheme, and moved nearer
together, lest her absence should be betrayed by a
telltale gap. Some of the other girls of course noticed
the occurrence, but, being loyal to Gipsy, they held
their tongues and made no sign. As gently as a
mouse she crept under the whole length of the table,
chuckling inwardly at the fun of the adventure.</p>

<p>I do not believe anyone in the school except Gipsy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
would have thought of such a rash and risky experiment;
but she had not yet entirely forgotten her old
Colonial habits, and every now and then, despite Miss
Poppleton's discipline, her wild spirits would crop
up and assert themselves in very questionable ways.
Miss Lindsay read calmly on, quite oblivious of the
fact that one of her pupils was crawling through the
doorway on all-fours, and that the greater proportion
of the rest were consciously aiding and abetting such
a scandalous proceeding. Once she had gained the
passage in safety, Gipsy sprang to her feet and ran
with all speed to the linen room. As she expected,
the light was still on, so she switched it off with
supreme satisfaction, congratulating herself heartily
that Miss Poppleton had not been before her. It was
only the work of a minute, and she hoped she could
regain her place at the table in the same way as she
had left it, without being missed by Miss Lindsay.
She was hurrying back along the passage when
Leonora, coming from practising, entered from the
opposite direction, and without seeing Gipsy or noticing
her frantic signs, went into the Juniors' room and
closed the door behind her.</p>

<p>The Peri shut out of Paradise was as nothing to
the disconcerted girl who stood blankly in the corridor.
Poor Gipsy was indeed in a dilemma. It was
utterly impossible to open the door and walk in, but
in the meantime every minute increased the probability
of her absence being detected. There seemed
nothing for it but to hang about on the chance that
Dilys or Barbara might also return from practising,
and that she could persuade one of them to leave the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
door open, so as to give her the opportunity of entering.
But the corridor was not a safe place to wait in.
Mistresses or Seniors might very possibly be passing,
and would ask awkward questions. It seemed more
discreet to retire downstairs, where she might catch
Dilys as she came from the library. There was a
large cupboard in the hall where the boarders kept
some of their outdoor clothes, and here Gipsy took
refuge, listening to the five difficult bars of a sonata
with which Dilys was wrestling, and wishing her
friend's half-hour at the piano might soon expire.
As she stood among the coats and waterproofs, peeping
out through a small chink of the door, she noticed
Miss Poppleton come from the drawing-room, and
cross the hall in the direction of the library. Gipsy
was in a panic of fright. What account should she
give of herself if her retreat were to be discovered?
Alarm made her draw her breath sharply, and the
action, combined perhaps with some dust or a slight
cold&mdash;alack! alack!&mdash;brought on a terrific and utterly
uncontrollable fit of sneezing.</p>

<p>"Ha-chaw! Ha-chaw! Ha-chaw!" issued from the
cupboard with horrible distinctness. Miss Poppleton
paused for a second, then made an instant dart, and
seized the culprit in the very midst of her fourth convulsive
gasp.</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed! So it's you, Gipsy Latimer, is it?"
said the Principal grimly. "What are you doing here,
I should like to know?"</p>

<p>Too much taken aback even to sneeze again, poor
Gipsy stood looking the picture of guilt, without
volunteering any explanation of her presence in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
cupboard. She felt that to do so would only involve
her in further difficulties. Miss Poppleton's keen, suspicious
eyes seemed to note every detail of her embarrassment.</p>

<p>"You've been out, Gipsy Latimer; it's easy enough
to tell that! So you're the one who's been seen every
evening in Mansfield Road!"</p>

<p>"Out!" gasped Gipsy, galvanized into speech by the
utter falsity of the accusation. "No, indeed! I haven't
been out of the house at all."</p>

<p>"It isn't the slightest use denying it," returned Miss
Poppleton harshly. "I might have known it would be
you. Besides&mdash;" (here she began to examine the waterproofs
and hats that were hanging upon the hooks),
"Oh, you wicked, wicked girl! Here's proof conclusive
that you are telling a deliberate untruth! Why, your
'sailor' and your mackintosh are quite wet! Look at
them, marked with your name, and try to deceive me
if you dare!"</p>

<p>"But, Miss Poppleton, indeed, indeed, you're mistaken!"
protested Gipsy with warmth. "If you want
proof, look at my shoes&mdash;they're not wet."</p>

<p>"You may think you're very clever, but you're not
able to blind me! Whose galoshes are these, I should
like to know, all muddy and covered with gravel? I
suppose you'll pretend your initials are not 'G. L.'
Go along immediately to your bedroom. I intend
to sift the matter to the bottom. So this is how you
repay me for my kindness in keeping you here!"</p>

<p>From Miss Poppleton's point of view the case against
poor Gipsy certainly looked extremely black. Apparently
she had been caught in the very act of returning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
from some clandestine excursion, and was leaving her
incriminatingly moist garments in the cupboard when
she was surprised.</p>

<p>The more the affair was investigated, the more
everything seemed to indicate her guilt. The girls
who had been present with her at preparation were
obliged, much against their will, to confess how she had
left the room without Miss Lindsay's knowledge by
crawling under the table, and what had been merely
a piece of mischief assumed a far graver aspect when
coupled with other circumstances. It was really a very
serious fault of which poor Gipsy was accused. She
was supposed not only to have set the school rules
deliberately at defiance by taking a surreptitious walk
alone in the evening, but to have shielded herself by
the most brazen falsehoods. Remembering how, when
she had first come to Briarcroft, she had begged to be
permitted to go out, had chafed against the confinement
of her life, and had constantly quoted the larger
liberty allowed in American schools, Miss Poppleton
could easily believe that she would be ready to break
bounds if she found a suitable opportunity; and though
hitherto Gipsy had been strictly truthful, her previous
reputation for honour could not do away with the
circumstantial evidence of the damp waterproof and
galoshes.</p>

<p>The neighbours who had reported noticing one of
the Briarcroft boarders in Mansfield Road on several
successive evenings could give no account of the truant's
personal appearance. It had been dusk at the time,
and they had only seen a girl in a sailor hat with a
blue-and-white striped band hurrying rapidly past, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
if anxious to escape observation. They thought she
had dark hair, and that she must be about fourteen or
fifteen years of age, but otherwise could not identify
her in the least. The description might or might not
fit Gipsy, but Miss Poppleton, misled by her own prejudice,
jumped immediately to the conclusion that she
and no other was the miscreant. If she had been
harsh with the girl before, she was terribly stern with
her now. She considered it an act of the very basest
ingratitude and the most double-dyed deceit, and was
the more particularly angry because the episode had
brought the school into discredit. She had always
prided herself upon the immaculate behaviour of her
boarders, and it was extremely galling to have such an
occurrence talked about in the neighbourhood. The
reputation of Briarcroft, hitherto above reproach, had
sustained a serious blow, from which it might take
some time to recover.</p>

<p>"This is what comes of fostering the children of
adventurers!" she said bitterly. "I feel as if I had
warmed a serpent, and it had turned and stung me
for my pains."</p>

<p>"I couldn't have believed it of Gipsy!" sobbed Miss
Edith, who, if anything, was even more concerned than
her sister, owing to her predilection for the offender.</p>

<p>"You were always much too generously disposed
towards her," sniffed Miss Poppleton. "She certainly
has not proved worthy of your kindness."</p>

<p>The affair made the most immense sensation in the
school. Nothing else was talked of next morning, and
the day girls questioned the boarders closely upon
every detail.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>"Isn't it awful?" sighed Lennie Chapman. "And
to think that we had to tell about her!"</p>

<p>"We don't believe she's really done it, though," protested
Hetty Hancock.</p>

<p>"It looks bad, I'm afraid," said Mary Parsons, shaking
her head gravely. "It's so queer!"</p>

<p>"Very queer for a girl who set herself up to teach
other people, like Gipsy," sneered Maude Helm. "What
do you think of your precious leader now?"</p>

<p>"Where is Gipsy?" asked Meg Gordon.</p>

<p>"Locked up in the dressing-room next Poppie's bedroom
till she confesses, and that she declares she won't
do, if she stays there till she dies! We've none of us
seen her, of course. We're forbidden to go anywhere
near."</p>

<p>"Oh, poor Gipsy! I'm so sorry for her! Whatever
did she go and do it for?" wailed Daisy Scatcherd.</p>

<p>"You don't for a second suppose Gipsy's guilty?"
said Meg Gordon indignantly. "If you do&mdash;well then,
you just don't know Gipsy Latimer, that's all!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>A Friend in Need</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Miss Poppleton</span>, having, as she deemed, successfully
detected Gipsy in her misdoings, was determined to
force her into making a full confession. The girl's
repeated denials she regarded as mere stubborn effrontery,
and after several stormy scenes she had locked
her up in the dressing-room, to try if a spell of solitary
confinement would reduce her to submission. Poor
Gipsy, agitated, overstrung, burning with a sense of
fierce anger against the injustice of her summary
condemnation, had faced the Principal almost like an
animal at bay, and defying her utterly, had persisted
in sticking without deviation to her own version of
the story.</div>

<p>"You'll gain nothing by this obstinacy!" stormed
Miss Poppleton. "I'll make you see who is in authority
here! Do you actually imagine I shall allow a girl
like you to set herself against the head of the school?
Here you stay until you own the truth and beg my
pardon."</p>

<p>"Then I'll stop here till I'm grown up, for I've told
the truth already," returned Gipsy desperately.</p>

<p>She had kept up a brave front in opposition to Miss
Poppleton's accusations; but after the key had turned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
in the lock, and the sound of footsteps died away down
the passage, she sank wearily into a chair, and burying
her hot face in her trembling hands, sobbed her
heart out. She felt so utterly deserted, friendless and
alone. There seemed nobody to whom she might turn
for help or counsel, nobody in all the wide, wide world
who belonged to her, and would defend her and take
her part. Everything appeared to have conspired
against her, and this final and most crushing blow
was the last straw. Gipsy clenched her fists in an
agony of hopelessness. "Oh, Dad, Dad! why don't you
come back?" she moaned, and the utter futility of the
question added to her misery. Outside the sun was
shining and the birds were singing cheerily&mdash;they
had their mates and their nests, while she had not
even a relation to claim her. She could hear the
voices of the girls as they took their eleven o'clock
recreation; each one had a joyful home to return to,
and parents or friends who would shield and protect
her.</p>

<p>"I've never had a home!" choked Gipsy. "Oh! I
wonder why some people are always left out of everything?"</p>

<p>Then she sat up suddenly, for there was the sound of
a hesitating footstep in the passage. The key turned,
the door opened gently, and Miss Edith, very nervous
and excited, entered the room.</p>

<p>"Oh, Gipsy!" she began tremulously, "Miss Poppleton
doesn't know I'm here, but I felt I must come.
Oh! you poor, naughty, naughty child, why did you
do it? How could you, Gipsy? I'd never have
thought it possible. Oh, do be a good girl and own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
up! Miss Poppleton will forgive you if you'll only
tell the truth&mdash;and you know you ought to! For
the sake of what's right, be brave, and don't go on
with this dreadful tissue of lies&mdash;it's too wicked and
terrible!"</p>

<p>Miss Edith's eyes were full of tears. She laid her
hand tenderly on the girl's shoulder, and looked at
her with a world of reproach in her twitching face.
If Miss Poppleton's scolding had been hard to endure,
Miss Edith's concern was far worse. Gipsy seized the
kind hand, and held it tightly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Edie, I can't bear you to misjudge me!"
she exclaimed bitterly. "Indeed, if you only knew, I
am telling the absolute, whole truth. Have I ever
told you an untruth before?"</p>

<p>"No, Gipsy. But this, alas! has been so conclusively
proved."</p>

<p>"But has it? It all rests on my wet waterproof and
galoshes. I don't know how they got wet, but I do
know that I didn't go out in them, and if I said I did,
why, then I should be really telling a falsehood."</p>

<p>Miss Edith sighed with disappointment, and drew
her hand reluctantly away.</p>

<p>"I thought I might have influenced you, Gipsy,"
she said, with a little sad catch in her voice. "I'm
not clever like my sister, but you were always fond
of me. I can't put things as she does, but I should
have liked to make you feel that doing right is worth
while for the sake of your own conscience. Oh, you
poor misguided child, do think it over, and make an
effort! You'll be glad all your life afterwards if you
own your fault, and start afresh. I can't stay any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
longer now&mdash;and you've no need to tell Miss Poppleton
that I came&mdash;but I'll be your friend, Gipsy, if
you'll only confess."</p>

<p>She lingered a moment, half hopefully; then, as
Gipsy only shook her head in reply, she gave up her
useless attempt, and went sorrowfully away. In black
despair Gipsy mentally went over the conversation,
wondering how she could have convinced Miss Edith
of her innocence. She could not allow herself to be
cajoled by kindness into a confession of what she
had not done, any more than she could permit herself
to be coerced by severity. Miss Edith might use
gentle persuasion, and Miss Poppleton might try to
cow her and break her spirit, but neither should succeed
in forcing her to a false admission.</p>

<p>Helen Roper came up at dinner-time with a plate
of meat and vegetables in one hand and a glass of
water in the other. She slammed them down hastily
on the table, with a scornful glance at the prisoner.</p>

<p>"That's all you'll get," she remarked brusquely.
"Miss Poppleton says you don't deserve pudding
to-day. And quite right, too! Bread and water'd be
enough for you, in my opinion. Why haven't you
the pluck to face things in an honourable way, and
say you're sorry for what you've done? I never much
cared for you, but I thought better of you than this.
For the sake of the school, do let's have an end of this
wretched business! 'Noblesse oblige' has been our
motto, and I hoped every girl would have risen to it.
Have you no self-respect?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;too much to say I've done what I haven't,"
retorted Gipsy, glowering her defiance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>Helen shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Miss Poppleton says you're as obstinate as a mule,
and she's about right!" she remarked tartly, as she
banged the door and locked it noisily behind her.
Gipsy was not hungry, so the plentiful supply of
meat and vegetables was quite sufficient for her needs,
and the lack of pudding was no grievance. Helen's
severe censure hurt her desperately. Had the girls
all condemned her equally without fair trial, and
without sifting the evidence against her? Did Hetty,
and Dilys, and Meg, and Lennie, her own particular
friends, consider her guilty? Had they no better
belief in her honour than that? Had everybody forsaken
her? Gipsy pushed her half-finished plateful
aside. She was choking too much with sobs to
swallow another morsel.</p>

<p>"There isn't a single soul here who cares! I shall
have to go away and find Dad!" she exploded in a
kind of desperation, standing up and scrubbing her
eyes with her wet pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>In the meantime Gipsy's friends had not altogether
abandoned her, as she supposed. They had been on
the alert all the morning to discover some means of
communicating with her, though, owing to Miss Poppleton's
vigilance, their efforts had so far met with ill success.
Any girl found loitering in the vicinity of the
passage that led to the dressing-room had been packed
off in a most summary fashion, with a warning not to
show herself there again under penalty of an imposition.
After dinner, however, Meg, who had secret
plans of her own, managed to dodge Miss Lindsay,
and by creeping under the laurels in the plantation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
made her way to a forbidden part of the garden which
commanded a view of the dressing-room window.
Exactly underneath this window stood a greenhouse
with a sloping glass roof, and at the corner of the
greenhouse there was a long down spout to drain the
gutters above. Meg advanced under cover of the
bushes with the caution of a scout, and reviewed the
position carefully before she ventured into the open.</p>

<p>"I believe I can manage it," she murmured. "My
toe would fit into that hole, and I could catch hold of
the bracket. I haven't learnt mountaineering for nothing,
and if I could tackle that crag on Hawes Fell
I oughtn't to be stumped by a gutter pipe. I flatter
myself there's not another girl in the school who
could do it, though. Between half-past one and two
is a good time. Probably no one will be round at this
side of the house, but I shall have to risk something,
and trust to luck."</p>

<p>The down spout certainly put Meg's climbing powers
to the utmost test. It was smooth and slippery, while
the footholds in the wall were of the very slenderest.
With considerable difficulty she swung herself up, and
creeping over the roof of the greenhouse reached the
small railed balcony that gave access to the dressing-room
window. She peeped in. There was Gipsy,
sitting, doing nothing, and looking the picture of disconsolate
misery.</p>

<p>"Gipsy!" called Meg, under her breath.</p>

<p>"Hello! It's never you! Oh, Meg, you angel!"</p>

<p>"Don't make such an idiotic noise, but help me in
quietly. Mum's the word! How are you getting on
here?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come in and I'll tell you. But you'll have to
whisk out pretty quickly if we hear Poppie's fairy
footsteps in the passage. We must listen with both
ears open while we talk."</p>

<p>"Trust me! Oh, Gipsy, we're all so sorry for you!"</p>

<p>"You believe in me, then? How does the school
take it?"</p>

<p>"Variously. Some are for you, and some are against.
Dilys and Lennie and Hetty of course stand up for
you hard, and funnily enough so does Leonora. She
took your part this morning quite hotly, and had such
a quarrel with Maude and Gladys that she won't speak
to them. I didn't think Leonora would have behaved
so decently. The Seniors are very dubious, especially
Helen Roper."</p>

<p>"Yes, Helen lashed into me when she brought my
dinner. She's always ready to think the worst of
me."</p>

<p>"Poppie's furious," continued Meg. "She says you're
only making your punishment worse by obstinate
falsehoods, and she means to make an example of
you."</p>

<p>"What's she going to do?" asked Gipsy with apprehension.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;she didn't condescend to tell us."</p>

<p>"Look here, I'm sick of the whole business!" said
Gipsy bitterly. "I'm not wanted at Briarcroft.
Poppie'd be only too delighted to get rid of me.
I'm not going to stay here any longer to be ordered
about and scolded, and accused of things I've never
done. I'll run away. If you can climb up the greenhouse
roof, I can climb down it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Gipsy! Where will you go? Come to us!
We'd hide you somewhere at home, and Mother
wouldn't give you up to Poppie, I know!"</p>

<p>But Gipsy shook her head emphatically. The very
fact of the Gordons' kindness made it impossible for
her to trespass upon their generosity. She knew that
if she were to seek sanctuary at their house, she would
place Mrs. Gordon in a most awkward and difficult
position, and her natural delicacy of feeling caused
her to shrink from such a course. It would be a poor
return indeed for their former hospitality.</p>

<p>"No, Meg; it's awfully good of you, but I must go
farther away than that. I'm off to Liverpool. Don't
look so staggered; I've quite made up my mind!"</p>

<p>"Liverpool! Why, that's miles and miles away!
How will you go? And what will you do when you
get there?"</p>

<p>"I shall manage somehow to sell my watch. It's a
gold one, you know, so it ought to be worth enough to
pay my railway fare, at any rate. It belonged to my
mother, and I wouldn't have parted with it under any
other circumstances than these. Thank goodness I put
it on this morning! I don't wear it always. When I
get to Liverpool I have a plan. Captain Smith&mdash;the
captain of the vessel we were wrecked on&mdash;lives at a
suburb called Waterloo. I'll enquire and enquire till
I find the house. If he's at home, it's just possible
that he could give me some little hint about my
father. Dad might have dropped something in talking
to him that he did not tell to me. I believe Captain
Smith would help me if he could."</p>

<p>"But suppose he's gone to sea again?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's quite likely. I've thought of that too.
Well, I mean to go to some of the shipping offices,
and see if they'll give me a post on a South African
liner as assistant stewardess. Don't look so frightfully
aghast! It's work I could do very well, though it
wouldn't be pleasant. I've travelled so much about
the world that I'm absolutely at home on board ship.
I know all the ins and outs of voyaging, and I'm a
splendid sailor, never seasick in the least. I could
make myself most uncommonly useful. I'd buy a
packet of hairpins and tuck up my hair so that I'd
look much older, and I believe they'd engage me,
because it's so difficult sometimes to meet with assistant
stewardesses. I'm nearly fifteen now, and I'd
rather earn my own living like that than stay here
at Briarcroft on Poppie's charity. American and
Colonial girls are never ashamed to work. When
I get out to Cape Town, I'll go to the headmistress
of the school where I stopped three months. She was
a trump, and I believe she'd help me to find Dad."</p>

<p>So bold a plan almost took Meg's breath away,
yet its ambitious daring appealed strongly to her
schoolgirl imagination. She had absolutely no knowledge
of the world, and the scheme which an older
person would have instantly vetoed sounded to her
inexperienced young ears not only perfectly feasible,
but delightfully enterprising and romantic. She
entered into it with enthusiasm, absolutely certain
that anything that Gipsy proposed must be right.
Having worshipped her friend for so long, she could
not believe her idol's judgment would be at fault.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what we'll do!" she exclaimed. "Let's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
change dresses! Then if Poppie tries to follow you, it
will throw her off the scent. Mine's longer than yours,
too, so it will be better for a stewardess."</p>

<p>"Won't they notice it in school? It might give the
thing away," hesitated Gipsy.</p>

<p>"It's Drawing the whole afternoon with Mr. Cobb,
and he won't know the difference. Quick, or somebody
may be coming! Take my hat too. I'll get
yours out of the cupboard, or go home without one.
None of the girls would tell, and I'll dodge mistresses."</p>

<p>It did not take very long for the pair to effect an
exchange of costumes. They were soon arrayed in
each other's dresses, an arrangement which was certainly
more to Gipsy's advantage than Meg's. They
knew there was no time to be lost, so, swinging themselves
over the balcony railings, they began creeping
cautiously down the greenhouse roof. They had just
about reached the middle when Meg, who was first,
suddenly stopped with a stifled exclamation, and lay as
flat and as still as she could. Gipsy naturally followed
suit, and looking downwards saw the reason for the
alarm. They were in horrible and imminent danger
of discovery. Miss Poppleton herself had entered the
conservatory below, and with a little watering can in
her hand began to attend to her plants. Would she
look up and notice the two dark bodies on the roof
above her?</p>

<p>Gipsy felt she had never been so thrillingly interested
in gardening in the whole of her life. She
watched while the geraniums and fuchsias received
their due sprinkling, and held her breath when the
Principal appeared about to stretch up to a hanging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
basket. Most fortunately for the two girls, she
changed her mind, and evidently thinking there was
not enough water in the can, emptied the remainder
on a box of seedlings, and went into the house for a
fresh supply.</p>

<p>"Now!" breathed Meg. "As quick as you can,
without putting your heels through the glass!"</p>

<p>"It was the nearest squeak!" gasped Gipsy, as
the pair, after a rapid slide down the gutter pipe,
reached the ground in safety. "She'll be coming
back directly."</p>

<p>"Rush under the shrubs&mdash;quick!" said Meg. "Oh,
I say! There's the bell! I must fly. I daren't walk
in late, or your dress might be noticed at call-over."</p>

<p>"I'm off too, then," returned Gipsy. "When Poppie
unlocks the dressing-room door, she'll find the bird has
flown!"</p>

<p>"Goodbye! I can't wait! Oh, Gipsy! when shall I
see you again?"</p>

<p>"Some day. I promise that! The bell's stopping!
You'll be late, Meg, if you don't scoot."</p>

<p>Torn in two between her reluctance to part from
her friend and her anxiety to be in time for call-over,
Meg hurried away without further farewell; and Gipsy,
in wildest fear of detection, metaphorically speaking
burnt her boats, and darting through the side gate,
ran with all possible speed down the high-road.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>A Tangled Story</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Meg</span> rushed to the lecture hall just in time to enter unobtrusively
among a crowd of other girls, and to take
her seat for afternoon call-over without attracting
special notice from mistresses or monitresses. She
congratulated herself on having been promoted to
Mr. Cobb's painting class. The fact of her change
of costume would be quite lost upon him, though
Miss Harris, the ordinary drawing mistress, might
possibly have recognized Gipsy's dress. One or two
of her Form mates stared at her curiously, but the
greater number were too much preoccupied with
answering "present" to their names, and filing away
to their various classes, to pay any particular attention
to her. The girls at the painting lesson, with the
exception of Fiona Campbell, were all Seniors. If
they realized any difference in Meg's appearance, there
was no opportunity either for them to make comments
or for her to give explanations. I am afraid the study
in oil colours of carnations, upon which she was engaged,
did not make much progress that afternoon, for
her thoughts were entirely about Gipsy, wondering
how far she had got upon her travels, and whether
Miss Poppleton had yet discovered her absence.</div>

<p>Directly the four o'clock bell rang and the class<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
was released, Meg, leaving the other girls leisurely
putting away their tubes of paints and cleaning their
palettes, scrambled her possessions together anyhow,
and bolted from the room before she could be questioned.
Going boldly to the boarders' cupboard in the
hall, she purloined Gipsy's hat, and, without waiting
even to tell her story to Hetty and Dilys, departed
from the premises with all possible speed.</p>

<p>She had come to school that day on her bicycle,
and fetching it hastily from the shed where all the
machines were stored, she rode away in the direction
of Greyfield. There was something slightly wrong
with one of her pedals, and her father had told her that
morning that she had better have it mended at once,
so she intended to take the cycle to the depot where
it had been bought, and let it be thoroughly overhauled
before she returned home. The assistant at the shop
promised to have the repairs finished in about half an
hour, and Meg therefore strolled into the town, to wait
with what patience she could muster. She walked
up Corporation Street and round by the Town Hall,
peeped into the Parish Church and the Free Library,
then finding herself close to the railway station, decided
to go and buy a copy of <i>Home Chat</i> or <i>Tit Bits</i>
at the bookstall.</p>

<p>"Want a ticket, Miss?" asked a porter, as she passed
the booking-office near the entrance.</p>

<p>"No, thank you; I'm only going to get a paper,"
replied Meg, walking briskly on.</p>

<p>She noticed that the man looked at her keenly, and
said something to another official. Immediately afterwards
an inspector came on to the platform, and eyed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
her with more than ordinary curiosity. She could
hear the telephone bell ringing hard, but it never
struck her that these occurrences had anything to do
with herself. She walked to the bookstall, and after
spending some minutes looking at the various magazines
spread forth, bought a copy of <i>Tit Bits</i>, and
strolled back down the platform reading it as she went,
and smiling over the jokes. At the automatic sweet-machine
she paused, put a penny in the slot, and had
just withdrawn her box of chocolates when, turning
round, she found herself face to face with a policeman.</p>

<p>"Very sorry, Miss," said the man civilly, "but I'm
afraid you've got to go along with me."</p>

<p>Meg was so surprised that she nearly dropped both
<i>Tit Bits</i> and the chocolates.</p>

<p>"To go along with you!" she gasped. "Indeed I
shan't do anything of the sort."</p>

<p>"Better not make a scene, Miss," advised the policeman,
with an indulgent smile. "I'm sorry, but it's
my duty to take you in charge."</p>

<p>"But what for? I've done nothing!" protested Meg
in huge indignation.</p>

<p>"That's a little matter between your schoolmistress
and yourself. It's none of my business. My instructions
are to take you straight to the police station."</p>

<p>"But I tell you I won't be taken!"</p>

<p>"Better go quietly, Missy," said the station inspector,
who had come bustling up. "You don't want to
attract a crowd, I'm sure, do you? No; then let me
put you in this cab, and drive you round to the police
station. It's only a couple of streets away. They'll
explain everything to you there."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>There was sense in his remarks, for people on the
platform were beginning to stop and stare at Meg
with an interest she deeply resented. To enter the
cab seemed the lesser evil, even if she must pay a
visit to the police station. The inspector handed her
in politely, and entering after, took the seat opposite,
while the policeman mounted the box beside the driver.</p>

<p>"They seem desperately afraid of my escaping! I
wonder they don't handcuff me!" thought Meg, waxing
more and more angry at the indignity of the proceeding.
The little drive only occupied a few minutes,
and arrived at the police station, she was shown at
once into the head inspector's office.</p>

<p>"I should like to know what charge you have
against me," demanded Meg, determined to hold her
own, and not to be frightened at her arrest.</p>

<p>"Withdrawing yourself from the hands of your
lawful schoolmistress and present guardian," replied
the inspector pompously.</p>

<p>"But I was only on my way home!"</p>

<p>The official, however, was busy reading something
from a notebook.</p>

<p>"'Surname Latimer, Christian name Gipsy. Height,
5 feet 1 inch. Eyes brown, complexion dark, hair
brown. Dressed in navy-blue alpaca frock over white
delaine blouse top, and probably wearing sailor hat
with blue-and-white striped band, and a pair of tennis
shoes.' The whole tallies exactly," he murmured, surveying
Meg from head to foot, to see that he had not
omitted any of the items.</p>

<p>"You're making a mistake. My name's Margaret
Gordon, not Gipsy Latimer! I live at The Gables,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
near Willowburn. My father is a solicitor in the
town. His office is at 15 Wells Street."</p>

<p>"We'll soon see about that. I think I must trouble
you for your pocket-handkerchief, Missy, please."</p>

<p>Considerably mystified, Meg felt in her pocket and
handed over the article in question. The inspector
examined it closely, then shook his head.</p>

<p>"It has 'G. Latimer' marked in the corner. That
doesn't look much like Margaret Gordon, does it?"</p>

<p>Meg was furious at her own stupidity. She and
Gipsy had never thought of exchanging the contents
of their pockets.</p>

<p>"Look here! Send for my father!" she begged.
"He'll soon tell you who I am, and explain the whole
matter."</p>

<p>"We don't need to send for anybody," returned the
official. "Miss Poppleton's quite enough for us. We've
got her description of you, and our instructions are
to take you straight back to the school. You'll find
you've not gained much by running away."</p>

<p>There was only one consolation for Meg, the
remembrance that her capture would possibly enable
Gipsy to escape in safety.</p>

<p>"They must have been looking out for her at the
railway station," she thought, "but they wouldn't
recognize her in my dress. I'd like to know what
Poppie'll say when I turn up instead!"</p>

<p>There was undoubtedly a humorous side to the
situation, and Meg laughed as she pictured the discomfiture
of the officials when they discovered their
mistake. It seemed of no further use to try to prove
her identity at present, so she allowed herself to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
once more escorted to the cab and driven off, this
time in the direction of Briarcroft.</p>

<p>"I wonder what sort of a scrape I'm in for," she
thought, as they drew up at the front door, and the
constable in charge solemnly marched her into the
house. Miss Poppleton came hurrying out of the
library into the hall, followed by Miss Edith.</p>

<p>"I am happy to be able to inform you, Madam, that
our search has been successful," said the policeman,
standing at attention.</p>

<p>"What? Have you found her?" cried Miss Poppleton
eagerly; then she stopped as she recognized Meg.
"Ah! So that's it, is it? I'm sorry to say, constable,
that you've brought the wrong girl!"</p>

<p>Meg had thought out her plan of action carefully
during her drive in the cab, and took advantage of
the sensation that followed to rush at the Principal
with an air of aggrieved and injured innocence.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Poppleton! Isn't it a horrible mistake!"
she exclaimed. "I told them my name, and they
wouldn't believe me! Oh! please, may I go home
immediately? My mother will be so dreadfully
anxious at my being so late!"</p>

<p>"Meg, do you know where Gipsy is?" interposed
Miss Edith, catching her by the arm.</p>

<p>"Indeed I don't; I haven't the least idea!" replied
Meg truthfully. "Please let me go home, and relieve
Mother's mind!"</p>

<p>"Yes, go at once!" answered Miss Poppleton distractedly;
and turning to the rueful constable, she
began to explain matters with much volubility.</p>

<p>Meg vanished like the wind, thankful that in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
general excitement nobody had remarked upon the
fact that she was wearing Gipsy's dress. She considered
that she had come out of the affair uncommonly
well, and congratulated herself upon her presence of
mind in the emergency. She hurried home as fast as
she could, anxious to tell the tale of Gipsy's escape
and her own adventure, and rather proud of her share
in both. To her surprise her mother took an utterly
different view of the case from her own.</p>

<p>"Gipsy run away!" cried Mrs. Gordon in great
consternation. "And you changed dresses with her
so as to help her? Oh, Meg! what have you done!
You naughty, foolish, foolish girl! You little know
the dangers you may have thrown her into. We must
do our utmost to find her and bring her back this
very evening. We should never forgive ourselves if
any harm came to her. I must telephone at once, and
see if Father's still at the office."</p>

<p>"But, Mummie darling, Gipsy doesn't want to be
caught and brought back to Poppie's tender mercies.
She's going to ship as a stewardess, and go to South
Africa to look for her father. I think it's ripping!"</p>

<p>"You don't know what you're talking about, Meg.
Gipsy is too young to manage her own affairs without
consulting her elders. I would have had the poor
child here, rather than that she should run away.
Tell me everything you can remember of her plans.
I expect Father will start for Liverpool at once in
search of her."</p>

<p>"You won't tell Poppie, Motherkins?"</p>

<p>"I shall send a note to Miss Poppleton as soon as I
have telephoned to Father. We must leave no stone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
unturned to find Gipsy. Miss Poppleton will be as
alarmed and anxious as I am myself. She may be a
little stern, but she is a good, conscientious person
in the main."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gordon's estimate of Miss Poppleton's character
was a correct one. The latter, though she had been
severe and even hard with Gipsy, had meant well by
her, and had intended to take charge of her until
she found an opportunity of sending her, under
careful protection, to her relations in New Zealand. She
was in a state of the utmost concern at the girl's
rash action in running away, and had lost no time in
summoning the aid of the police to track her and
ensure her safety. If Gipsy were the black sheep of
the flock, she was at any rate the lost sheep, to be
sought for diligently, and rejoiced over when found.</p>

<p>To Miss Edith the affair was a sad blow. She was
genuinely fond of Gipsy, and had been greatly distressed
by the events of the last few days. Though
she dutifully accepted her sister's opinion, and believed
Gipsy guilty, she nevertheless was ready to welcome
back the prodigal with open arms. She did not dare
to break down before Miss Poppleton, who disliked a
public exhibition of feeling, so she retired to the linen
room to wipe her eyes in private. Having indulged
in a little surreptitious weeping she felt better, and
decided to try to distract her mind by tidying her
cupboards. Now, though Miss Edith was on the
whole a good housekeeper, she had a poor memory,
and was very apt to put things away and forget all
about them. As she rearranged her drawers and
shelves on this particular evening, she was dismayed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
to find several articles for which she had searched in
vain elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Why, here's the tea cloth that I thought had been
lost in the wash!" she exclaimed. "And Miss Lindsay's
dressing jacket&mdash;she was afraid she must have
left it in London. Why! and here's a coat of Daisy
Scatcherd's. I remember quite plainly putting it by
last autumn, when she had such a terrible cold. I
thought it was too thin for her to wear. Why didn't
the child ask me for it? She's as forgetful as I am.
It's just the thing for chilly evenings, to slip on when
she's been playing tennis."</p>

<p>Miss Edith gave the coat a good shake, and as she
did so there fell from the pocket an unopened letter.
She picked it up and looked at the address:</p>

<div class='center'>
"<span class="smcap">Miss Gipsy Latimer</span>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Briarcroft Hall,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Greyfield,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">England."</span><br />
</div>

<p>She read it twice before she realized its significance.
Then, trembling violently, she sank on to a chair,
and gave way to what very closely resembled a fit
Of hysteria.</p>

<p>"Fetch Miss Poppleton!" she cried to the alarmed
servant who ran to the linen room at the sound of
her wails. "Oh, dear! To think it's all my fault!"</p>

<p>Miss Poppleton hurried to the scene at once, and
though at first her sister's explanation was rather incoherent,
she managed to grasp the main facts of the case.</p>

<p>"It's Gipsy's missing letter, Dorothea! It must have
come after all, you see, only I can't imagine how it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
got into Daisy Scatcherd's pocket. I don't remember
looking in the pockets when I put the coat by. And
it's been there all this time! Look, the postmark is
Cape Town, 3 November. Oh, isn't it dreadful? And
the poor, dear child has just run away! Dorothea,
whatever are we to do about it?" moaned Miss Edith,
almost beside herself with horror at her discovery.</p>

<p>"In the circumstances I consider I am perfectly
justified in reading the letter," replied Miss Poppleton,
solemnly tearing open the envelope. "Why, here's an
enclosure for me inside it!"</p>

<p>The long-delayed missive was from Gipsy's father,
and contained the very information for which Miss
Poppleton had waited more than six weary months.
Mr. Latimer informed her that he was on the point of
starting with a pioneering expedition to prospect for
minerals in the almost unexplored district at the
sources of one of the tributaries of the Zambesi. It
might be several months before he would be in any
civilized place whence it would be possible for him to
communicate with her again, but during his absence
he was glad to know that his little daughter was left
in good hands. For all expenses in connection with
Gipsy's education, dress, and pocket-money, he begged
to refer her to his London bankers, Messrs. Hall &amp; Co.
of Lombard Street, who had instructions to settle the
account as soon as submitted to them.</p>

<p>"I hope my girlie will behave well, and give no
trouble," he wrote. "She is generally ready to attach
herself to anybody who is kind to her."</p>

<p>Miss Poppleton turned a dull crimson as she finished
reading the letter, and handed it to Miss Edith.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>"I must question Daisy Scatcherd at once," she
remarked peremptorily. "I can't understand how
the letter came to be in her pocket at all."</p>

<p>The luckless Daisy, subjected to a searching examination,
could at first render no account of how she
came to be mixed up in the affair. Then little by
little a vague remembrance returned to her, and she
began dimly to recall the circumstances.</p>

<p>"It must have been on my birthday," she faltered.
"I have a kind of recollection that I stopped the postman
in the drive, and he gave me several letters. But
indeed I never noticed one for Gipsy! If I even looked
at the name, I didn't take it in properly. I suppose I
only saw it wasn't for me, and stuffed it in my pocket
while I opened my own letters. Then I utterly forgot
all about it."</p>

<p>"It must be a warning to you, Daisy, against carelessness&mdash;a
warning to last you the rest of your life,"
said Miss Poppleton, relieving her feelings by improving
the occasion. "Your thoughtless act has had the
most unfortunate consequences. It's no use crying
now" (as Daisy dissolved into tears). "You can't
mend matters. But I hope you'll take this to heart,
and be more careful in future."</p>

<p>"If we could only find that poor, unfortunate child,
Gipsy," sobbed Miss Edith, when the weeping Daisy
had taken her departure. "I always said perhaps her
father wasn't an adventurer after all. I think you
were too hard on her, Dorothea&mdash;too hard altogether!"
Which, was the nearest approach to insubordination
that Miss Edith, in all her years of meek subserviency
to her sister, had ever yet dared to venture upon.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>Gipsy at Large</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">And</span> where, all this time, was Gipsy, whom we left
running down the road in the direction of Greyfield?</div>

<p>She tore along at the top of her speed, until she had
put a considerable distance between herself and Briarcroft;
then, panting and almost breathless, she slackened
her pace, and looked round to see whether anyone
was following her. As nobody of a more suspicious
character than an errand boy and a nurse girl with a
perambulator was in sight, she began to congratulate
herself that she had escaped unobserved. How soon
her absence would be discovered depended upon when
Miss Poppleton or one of the monitresses next paid a
visit to the dressing-room; and she laughed to picture
the consternation that would ensue when the door
was unlocked and her prison found to be vacant. No
doubt they would send in search of her, but in the
meantime she had stolen a march upon them, and
given herself the advantage of a start, so she hoped
by using all possible haste to get away before she was
traced.</p>

<p>As she strode rapidly along, all her old vagabond
instincts arose, and the gipsy element which had
justified her name came strongly to the fore. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
a delightful, mild afternoon, with blue sky and bright
sunshine; the gardens on either side of the road were
gay with pink hawthorn and long, drooping sprays
of laburnum, while blackbirds, thrushes, chaffinches,
and tits were singing in a perfect chorus of joy. It
felt so glorious to be as free as the birds, to be rid of
all the tiresome rules and restrictions and conventions
that had oppressed her soul for the last eight months,
to be accountable to nobody but herself, and to be
able to do just what she chose and go where she liked.
School seemed as a nightmare behind her, and the
world a fresh wonderland which it was her happy
privilege to have the chance to explore.</p>

<p>"I'll never go back again&mdash;never!" she resolved.
"Not if I have to sweep a crossing or sell flowers!
But I don't think it will come to that, because I'm
sure I can get a post on board ship. Oh, what a
blissful relief it is to be on my own for once! I've
made up my mind to find Dad, if I have to go to the
ends of the earth to hunt for him."</p>

<p>In the exuberance of her spirits she almost danced
along, humming now Schubert's "Wander Song",
with its ringing refrain:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Oh! surely he must careless be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Who never loved to wander free,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To wander! To wander!"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>or "The Miller of Dee", with special emphasis on the
words:</div>

<div class='poem'>
"I care for nobody, no, not I!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And nobody cares for me."</span><br />
</div>

<p>The sight of the town of Greyfield, with its streets<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
and shops, changed the current of her thoughts, and
brought the more sober reflection that she had no
money in her pocket, and that it was a matter of
urgent necessity to obtain some if she meant to reach
Liverpool and start for South Africa. The fare, she
knew, was about seven shillings, and though she hoped
to be able to embark on board ship almost immediately
after her arrival at the port, she supposed she would
require something in the way of food on the journey.
It went to her heart to be obliged to sell her beautiful
gold watch, but in the circumstances it seemed the
only thing to be done, and she braced her mind to
part with it. She had no previous experience of selling
things, so, choosing out the best jeweller's shop in
the High Street, she marched blithely in, and taking
off her watch and chain laid them upon the counter.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss; want repairing, I suppose?" enquired
the assistant who came to attend to her.</p>

<p>"No, they're in perfectly good order; but I wish to
sell them. What price can you give me for them?"
returned Gipsy confidently.</p>

<p>The man looked at her in decided astonishment,
then pushed back the watch across the counter with
a marked decrease of civility.</p>

<p>"We don't do that kind of business," he replied
shortly.</p>

<p>"Won't you buy it then?" asked Gipsy in accents
of blank disappointment.</p>

<p>"No; it's not in our line at all."</p>

<p>"Then where should I be able to sell it?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't say; probably at a secondhand shop. We
only deal in new articles."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>Very much disconcerted and snubbed, Gipsy snatched
up her watch and chain and fled from the shop. She
had evidently made a mistake in applying at a first-class
jeweller's, and she was angry at having exposed
herself to the humiliation of a rebuff. With two
flaming spots in her cheeks, she stalked down the
High Street, and into one of the narrower and more
modest by-streets, where smaller shops were to be
found. She walked on for quite a long way without
meeting with any place that looked in the least degree
likely; then at last, at the corner of an even humbler
street still, she found a secondhand furniture dealer,
who, to judge by the contents of his windows, seemed
also to trade in a variety of miscellaneous articles. On
the pavement in front of the shop were spread forth
specimens of chairs, tables, and washstands, and inside
she could see a goodly array of glass, antique china,
old jewellery, old silver, prints, pictures, books, candlesticks,
firearms, and an assortment of small pieces of
bric-&agrave;-brac. Over the door was the name of Daniel
Lucas.</p>

<p>"This looks more the kind of place," she murmured.
"I'll have a try here, at any rate."</p>

<p>The interior of the shop was so crowded with furniture
that it was quite difficult to walk between the
piled-up sideboards and sofas to the corner where a
very dirty and shabby-looking individual, with untidy
grey hair and unshaven chin, was busy adding
up accounts. He paused with a grimy finger in the
middle of a column of figures, and peered at Gipsy
with a pair of red, bleary eyes.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 319px;">
<img src="images/gs05.jpg" width="319" height="500" alt="&quot;HE PAUSED AND PEERED AT GIPSY&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;HE PAUSED AND PEERED AT GIPSY&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"I see you sell secondhand jewellery here, and want<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
to know if you care to buy a watch," she began, with
rather less assurance than at her former interview.</p>

<p>"It depends on the article. Have you brought it
with you?" replied the old man cautiously.</p>

<p>"It's real gold, and so is the chain," volunteered
Gipsy, as she produced her treasure.</p>

<p>Mr. Daniel Lucas examined both watch and chain
with minute care, then shook his head deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it wouldn't be of much use to me. You
see, it's not exactly in the nature of an antique," he
replied.</p>

<p>Gipsy's face fell. To get the money for her journey
was a matter of vital importance.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you offer me anything for it?" she
pleaded.</p>

<p>The bleary red eyes glanced at her keenly, and
appeared to appreciate her disappointment.</p>

<p>"Well, to oblige you, I might go to a matter of
seven and six."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you possibly make it ten shillings, with
the chain?" hazarded Gipsy. She had no idea of the
value of secondhand articles, and thought only of what
amount would take her to Liverpool.</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;with the chain. But it's a poor bargain
for me, mind you. I'm only doing it just to oblige
you," returned Mr. Lucas, opening a drawer and
counting out four half-crowns with an alacrity that
belied his words. Thankful to have concluded the
transaction on any terms, Gipsy seized the money and
beat a hasty retreat. She was extremely anxious to
reach the station before Miss Poppleton missed her
and sent somebody in search of her. She had no idea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
of the times of the trains, but trusted to luck to catch
the next that would take her anywhere in the right
direction. With her four precious half-crowns grasped
tightly in her hand, she hurried back up the sordid
street, and took the shortest cut possible to the railway
station. There was quite a crowd at the booking
office, so she was able to take her place in the queue
of prospective travellers and to obtain her ticket
without attracting any special attention.</p>

<p>"Liverpool?" said the inspector who stood at the
platform door. "You've just time if you're quick.
That's the train over there on No. 3."</p>

<p>Gipsy fled across the bridge with a speed that
seriously interfered with the convenience of passengers
coming in the opposite direction; she rattled
down the steps on to Platform 3, and, nearly falling
over a pile of luggage, flung herself into the first
third-class compartment that came to hand.</p>

<p>"Am I right for Liverpool?" she gasped tremulously
to the collector who came to punch her ticket.</p>

<p>"Quite right, Miss; change at Preston, that's all,"
replied the man as he slammed the door.</p>

<p>The porters were thrusting some boxes into the
luggage van, and a few latecomers made a last dash
for carriages; then the green flag waved, the whistle
sounded, and the train started with a jerk. Gipsy,
hot, excited, and agitated, drew a long, long breath
of relief. She was actually off! They were speeding
fast out of the station, and she was leaving Greyfield
and Briarcroft, and all the painful experiences of
the last few months, entirely behind her. She could
hardly believe her good luck in thus slipping away<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
unobserved. True, she had only a half-crown and two
pennies left after paying her fare, but she supposed
that would be enough to last her until she could go
on board a vessel. Surely chance had favoured her in
enabling her to reach the station in the nick of time
to catch the train, and no doubt she would be equally
fortunate when she reached Liverpool. Her fellow
passengers were uninteresting, and she had no desire
to talk to anyone and confide her affairs, so she
amused herself with her own thoughts and plans for
the future. At Preston she changed, and bought a
bun at the refreshment rooms; her dinner had been
almost untasted, and she was growing hungry now.
It seemed funny to have absolutely no luggage, though
in one respect it was a great convenience not to be
obliged to haul about a heavy handbag, or to tip a
porter out of her extremely small capital.</p>

<p>"I feel almost as if I'd been shipwrecked again&mdash;in
a borrowed dress and hat, and nothing else to call my
own!" she thought with a smile.</p>

<p>It was half-past six before the train arrived at the
big Liverpool terminus&mdash;rather late in the day to
begin all the numerous enquiries which Gipsy was determined
to make; but, nothing daunted, she set out
at once for Waterloo, to try to find the residence of
her old friend Captain Smith. She was directed by a
policeman to take an overhead electric car, and travelled
several miles above what seemed a wilderness
of streets before she reached the suburb in question.
Not knowing where to make a beginning, she decided
to go first to a post office, thinking that there she
might be able to gain the information she wanted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
She had somehow imagined Waterloo to be quite a
little place, where by diligent enquiry it would be
fairly easy to trace such an important person as a sea
captain who had been wrecked in the Bay of Biscay;
greatly to her dismay, however, she found herself
in the midst of what seemed a large city in itself&mdash;a
veritable maze of long streets and small houses,
stretching away into the distance with an endless
vista of chimneypots. In a distinctly sober frame of
mind she entered the post office and proffered her
question.</p>

<p>"Smith? I couldn't tell you, I'm sure; there are so
many Smiths," said the girl at the counter, with a
superior smile. "One of them may be a sea captain,
for anything I know. You'd better look in the
Directory."</p>

<p>Gipsy seized upon the book with a sense of relief,
and carried it off to a less busy part of the office. She
turned up Waterloo, found the list of residents, and
went through them in alphabetical order till she
reached the letter S. She was appalled to see the
number of Smiths who resided at Waterloo. To some
of the names the Directory had appended an occupation,
but with many it gave no details. Taking one of
the telegraph forms she wrote down the addresses of
about a dozen Smiths who, she considered, might be
likely; then, returning the Directory to the girl at
the counter, she started off on her arduous quest.</p>

<p>"I shall go to 'Ocean Villa' first," she thought. "It
has a particularly nautical sound. I shouldn't think
anybody but a sea captain could possibly live there.
'The Anchorage' sounds hopeful too, though it ought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
to be the home of somebody who is retired. 'Sea
View Cottage' is doubtful, but 'Teneriffe House' is
likely. The <i>Queen of the Waves</i> used to touch sometimes
at Teneriffe. Oh, dear! the trouble will be to
hunt out where they all are."</p>

<p>Poor Gipsy had indeed undertaken a most difficult
task. She was obliged to ask her way again and
again, and when at length she arrived at "Ocean
Villa" it was only to meet with the information that
nobody of a seafaring description was known there.
Much disappointed, she trudged away in an opposite
direction to find "The Anchorage", and after walking
half a mile or more in search of it, was again confronted
with ill success. At "Sea View Cottage" and
"Teneriffe House" she fared no better; the occupiers,
albeit they belonged to the great family of Smiths,
had no connection whatever with the sea: and though
she went to several other addresses on her list, the
answer was invariably the same.</p>

<p>Utterly tired out, weary and despondent, Gipsy
retraced her steps in the direction of the post office.
Having parted with her watch, she had no idea of
the time, but catching sight of a clock in a public
building, she was horrified to find it was nearly a
quarter to nine. The days at that season of the year
were long, and this particular evening had been more
than usually light; moreover, she had been entirely
preoccupied with her quest, so she had never given a
thought to the rapidly passing hours. For the first
time the question of where she must sleep presented
itself to her.</p>

<p>"I must get back to Liverpool," she thought, "and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
apply at one of the shipping offices. The docks aren't
very far away, so I can get engaged as stewardess and
go on board some ship at once, I expect."</p>

<p>But in the meantime a meal was an urgent necessity.
She was sick and faint from want of food, and
felt as if her tired feet could scarcely carry her farther.
Seeing a modest confectioner's shop with a notice
"Teas Provided", she went in and asked for some refreshment.
The proprietress, a little elderly woman,
struck partly by the weary look on her face, and
partly by the unusual circumstance of a girl of her age
coming into the shop alone to ask for tea at so late an
hour, took her into a small parlour, and while laying
the table and bringing in the meal, insinuated a few
skilful questions as to where she was going. Gipsy
had decided to pose as a working girl, so she answered
readily enough that she was on her way to Liverpool,
to find a post as assistant stewardess; and she wished
to be very quick over her tea, so that she might go
at once to the shipping offices, procure an engagement,
and proceed at once to her vessel.</p>

<p>The expression on the woman's face changed from
curiosity to sympathy, and then to utter consternation,
as Gipsy briefly stated her intentions.</p>

<p>"But my goodness gracious! You'll never get a
situation at this time of night!" she broke out. "Why,
don't you know all the offices close at half-past five?"</p>

<p>Gipsy had not known, and the news struck her like
a deadly blow.</p>

<p>"The offices all closed! Do you mean to say I can't
get on board ship to-night?" she gasped. "Then where
in the world am I to go?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>The woman shook her head dubiously.</p>

<p>"Best go back where you've come from," she remarked.</p>

<p>"I can't! I can't!" cried Gipsy. "That's absolutely
impossible. Oh! why didn't I know of this before?
What shall I do? What shall I do?" and springing
up excitedly from the table, she burst into a flood of
tears. For the first time she realized what an extremely
rash thing she had done in running away, and
in what a terrible position she had placed herself.
Alone, friendless, and nearly penniless, in the midst
of a great, strange city, with no one who knew her,
nowhere to go, and the light already fading so fast
that it was dark in the little parlour! She had acted
almost on the spur of the moment in leaving Briarcroft,
without seriously considering whether her plans
were practicable, and now she was reaping the bitter
harvest of her own folly. She began heartily to wish
herself back at school; even Miss Poppleton's severest
scolding was as nothing to the misery of this present
crisis, and she yearned for the sight of Miss Edith
with a longing that amounted to home-sickness. Wishing
and regretting, however, would not help her in the
least. She must find some way out of her difficulty,
and that promptly.</p>

<p>"I've only one and ninepence left," she faltered.
"And out of that I have to pay for my tea and keep
a few pennies to go back into Liverpool with by
the car. Could I get a night's lodging anywhere
very cheaply? Do you know of a clean place?"</p>

<p>"Better not try cheap lodgings!" said the woman
emphatically. "Can't you go home again? No?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
That's a bad lookout." Then, noticing the utter agony
in Gipsy's face, she added: "Well, I'd be sorry to turn
a young girl like you out alone at this time of night.
I'll let you sleep on the sofa here, if you can manage,
and you can get on to Liverpool first thing in the
morning."</p>

<p>Manage? Gipsy would have slept on the floor, instead
of the sofa, if required. She was only too thankful
to be allowed to stay, and was almost ready to
hug the little confectioner with gratitude. She was so
utterly wearied that she was glad to lie down at once
in the parlour, and even before the tea-things were
removed from the table she had sunk into a sleep of
absolute exhaustion. Her hostess scanned her face
narrowly, took in the details of her dress, and examined
her school hat with attention, then shook her
head.</p>

<p>"Doesn't look much in the stewardess line of business,"
she muttered. "There's something wrong here,
I'm afraid. I'll have a talk with her to-morrow."
Then she locked the parlour door carefully before she
went back to the shop.</p>

<p>Gipsy slept straight on until eight o'clock the next
morning, when she was aroused by her landlady, who
brought her a cup of tea and a piece of thick bread
and butter.</p>

<p>"If you'll take the advice of one who knows more
of the world than you," said the woman, "you'll go
back home as fast as you can. Your own folks are
the best to look after you. If you've spent all your
money, they'd help you at the police station. They'll
always send a girl back to her friends." Then, leaving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Gipsy to digest her remarks while eating her breakfast,
she went to perform household tasks.</p>

<p>The last hint put Gipsy in a panic. With her long
night's rest her spirits had revived, and her courage
returned. The idea of seeking her father in South
Africa appeared once more attractive, and she had
no wish to be taken charge of by the police and
ignominiously packed back to school. She wondered
whether the little confectioner had already gone to
inform a constable of her whereabouts. She could and
would not allow herself to be thus treated. Hurriedly
finishing the tea and bread and butter, she laid all her
money, with the exception of sixpence, on the table,
and finding the shop door already open, made her
escape into the street. It felt almost like running
away a second time, and she was sorry not to have
said "Thank you!" for her night's lodging, but she
considered the emergency to be critical, and was glad
when she turned the corner and was out of sight of
the shop. She made her way as fast as possible to the
electric railway, and took the first car for Liverpool,
determined not to waste any further time in looking
for Captain Smith at Waterloo, but to try her utmost
to obtain a berth as stewardess. By dint of diligent
asking, she managed to find the quarters of one of the
shipping companies that ran a line of steamers to
South Africa, and after toiling up a long flight of
stairs she boldly entered the office, and stated her
business to an astonished clerk. He gave her one
comprehensive glance, screwed up his mouth, and
most impolitely whistled.</p>

<p>"Whew! You're rather juvenile for the job, ain't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
you?" he asked facetiously. "Ever been on the sea
before? 'Tisn't nice when it's rough, I can tell you."</p>

<p>"I'm older than I look," returned Gipsy with dignity,
suddenly remembering, however, to her confusion, that
she had forgotten to buy a box of hairpins and turn
up her hair. "That's to say, I'm quite old enough to
be very useful on board ship, and I know all about
long voyages. I'd like to speak to the head of the
office."</p>

<p>"I dare say you would! But he's not here yet&mdash;never
comes down till ten or half-past, and I don't
believe he'd see you, either. We're not wanting any
stewardesses at present&mdash;leastways, those we engage
have to be on the wrong side of thirty."</p>

<p>"I'll wait and see the head of the office," announced
Gipsy firmly.</p>

<p>"Well! Of all the cheek&mdash;!"</p>

<p>But at that moment the telephone bell rang violently
in an inner room, and the clerk fled to the instrument.
After a few minutes he returned, and with a complete
change in his manner asked Gipsy to take a seat.</p>

<p>"The Chief will be here before long," he said affably.
"If you don't mind waiting a little, I can promise it
will be to your advantage."</p>

<p>Gipsy sat down on one of the office chairs, and
amused herself for about the space of ten minutes in
studying the shipping advertisements that were hung
round the walls. She turned eagerly at last when a
footstep was heard upon the staircase. Was it the
manager of the Tower Line, she wondered, and would
he after all be willing to engage her for the work she
desired? Her heart beat and throbbed as the door<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
swung open. But instead of a stranger appeared the
familiar figure of her friend Meg's father.</p>

<p>"Gipsy! Gipsy!" cried Mr. Gordon reproachfully.
"Thank Heaven I've found you! Come along with
me at once, child! We must go straight back to
Greyfield by the next express."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>The United Guild Festival</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Mr. Gordon</span> had been most seriously concerned at the
news of Gipsy's unauthorized flight, and considering
the part which his daughter Meg had played in helping
her to escape, he held himself to be morally responsible
for the consequences of so foolish a step, and had
started at once for Liverpool in search of the truant.
Until very late at night he had used all efforts to
trace her, but without success; then as soon as possible
in the morning, acting on the knowledge of Gipsy's
plans which Meg had supplied, he had telephoned to
every steamship company in the city that ran vessels
to South Africa, giving a description of the girl, and
asking, if she called at the office, that she might be
detained until he could arrive and claim her. By a
fortunate chance he rang up the Tower Line at the
very time when Gipsy had presented herself to enquire
for work, so, jumping into a taxicab, he had driven
immediately from his hotel to their offices.</div>

<p>On the whole, Gipsy was so relieved to see a friend
who was prepared to take charge of her that she submitted
quite peaceably to be escorted back to Greyfield.
The clerk's hilarity at her application for a
stewardess-ship, and his assurance that such posts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
were only given to middle-aged women, had upset
her calculations, and remembering her forlorn condition
of the previous night, she was glad not to risk
a repetition of such a painful experience. Mr. Gordon
had at first intended to take her home with him to
The Gables, but on telephoning to his wife on his arrival
at Greyfield station, he learnt about the missing
letter which had been discovered in Daisy Scatcherd's
coat pocket, and decided it would be better for her
to go straight to Briarcroft.</p>

<p>The prospect of a letter from her father was a
magnet more than sufficient to draw Gipsy back to
school. All fear of Miss Poppleton's wrath faded
away in the excitement of this wonderful news.</p>

<p>"And to think that if I'd gone to South Africa I
should have missed it!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Miss Poppleton received the prodigal with wonderful
graciousness, and Miss Edith wept over her, upbraided
her, and kissed her all at once.</p>

<p>"Gipsy, darling! How could you be so naughty?
You might have known we were your best friends.
I never slept all night for worrying about you; and
I'm sure Miss Poppleton didn't either. To think that
you should have run away from us! And your letter
was there all the time, if we'd only known! It's locked
up safely in my desk, all ready for you."</p>

<p>"Give it me now, please!" pleaded Gipsy.</p>

<p>Although Gipsy's return to Briarcroft had been a
very desirable conclusion to the episode of her running
away, there were several matters left which remained
in a far from satisfactory condition. In the first place,
though her father's letter had relieved all anxiety about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
her school fees and general expenses, and removed her
from her former most unpleasant position, it did not
give any clue to his present whereabouts. Beyond the
brief information that he was going to the sources
of a tributary of the Zambesi, she knew nothing.
There was no address given to which she might write,
or any definite date fixed for his return to civilization.
The London bankers, with whom Miss Poppleton at
once communicated, had no further knowledge. He
seemed to have disappeared into the unexplored wilds
of Central Africa, and to have left no trace. In view
of the dangers to which a pioneering party, such as he
had joined, would be exposed from wild beasts, hostile
natives, lack of food and water, or the hardships of
travelling in the interior of the continent, there was
cause for considerable uneasiness on his behalf. It
seemed high time that some news was received of the
expedition. It was now seven months from the date
of Mr. Latimer's letter, and he had apparently expected
to return in three or four.</p>

<p>Poor Gipsy conjured up all kinds of fears for her
father's safety. She imagined him ill in some inaccessible
spot, without medical aid, or taken prisoner by a
native chief, or&mdash;more terrible still&mdash;that he had succumbed
to the dangers and difficulties of the journey.
She carried his letter about as her greatest treasure,
and kissed it a dozen times a day; but she felt that,
while appreciating its possession, she found it a very
unsatisfactory substitute for the fuller details she
coveted of his present welfare.</p>

<p>Her second trouble was the fact that she was still
supposed to be guilty of that surreptitious outing in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the evening, and to have flatly told falsehoods to
screen herself. Gipsy had many faults, but she was
strictly truthful, and this imputation against her
honour rankled sorely. Miss Poppleton had not pressed
the matter, probably thinking it a secondary consideration
to her greater crime of running away. In her relief
at receiving a handsome cheque from Mr. Latimer's
bankers, the Principal had decided to forgive Gipsy's
past indiscretions, and to start afresh on a different
basis. By a little rearrangement she managed to find
room for Gipsy again in her old dormitory, and the
manifold odd duties which had been assigned to her
were entirely removed. Once back in her favourite
No. 3, with a new set of summer clothes and an ample
supply of pocket-money, Gipsy felt reinstated in her
former position in school. With the utmost satisfaction
she paid up her arrears of subscriptions to the
Guild, and put straight several other little matters
where she felt she owed a moral if not an actual
debt.</p>

<p>"There's only one thing that makes me savage," she
declared one evening to some of her own set who were
assembled in the Juniors' room, "and that is that
Poppie still believes I told those awful fibs about not
going out that wet evening. On my honour I spoke
the truth. Somebody else must have gone out in my
waterproof."</p>

<p>"What does it matter, now it's all over?" asked
Leonora. "Poppie's forgiven you."</p>

<p>"Why, it matters a great deal. I don't want to be
forgiven for what I've never done. And I don't care
to possess a reputation for telling fibs. Whoever went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
out in my cloak ought to own up, and if she doesn't,
she's a mean, detestable, contemptible sneak!"</p>

<p>"Shielding herself at your expense!" added Hetty
indignantly.</p>

<p>Leonora turned as crimson as the woolwork she
was stitching.</p>

<p>"I never thought of it in that way! It really never
struck me!" she gasped. "I'm sure I've no wish to
shield myself at anybody's expense. Why, if you
want to know, it was I who went out in your waterproof
and galoshes."</p>

<p>Leonora's announcement made the sensation it deserved.</p>

<p>"You! You!" cried the amazed girls.</p>

<p>"But why did you go?"</p>

<p>"How could you do such a thing?"</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell?"</p>

<p>"I went for a very simple reason," replied Leonora
coolly. "You know how fond I am of sweets, and
what an abominably mean rule there is here about
our not buying them. Well, I just couldn't stand
doing without my chocolates, so I used to dodge out
whenever I dared to that little shop in Mansfield Road,
and buy some. On that particular wet evening I was
in a fearful hurry to go before I began practising, so
I rushed to the hall cupboard and seized on the first
waterproof and hat and galoshes that came to hand.
I didn't know they were Gipsy's."</p>

<p>"And yet you let her bear the blame!" exclaimed
Dilys heatedly.</p>

<p>"I thought, as she hadn't really done it, she'd very
soon clear herself. She could have 'proved an alibi'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
directly, if the thing had been properly gone into.
There were heaps of girls who could have witnessed
for her. Even though she did crawl under the table
and go out of the room, the times didn't fit in, as
Poppie would have found directly, if she'd troubled
to ask."</p>

<p>"That's true. Poppie was utterly prejudiced; she
asked a few hasty questions, never noticed whether
the stories agreed, and jumped to a conclusion," said
Hetty.</p>

<p>"Then, when Gipsy came back, Poppie dropped the
matter entirely," continued Leonora. "I thought she
knew she'd made a mistake. I didn't see any use in
getting myself into trouble if I could help it, so I held
my tongue."</p>

<p>"And disgustingly mean of you, too!" exploded
Lennie.</p>

<p>"You're the most extraordinary girl, Leonora! I
never saw anybody like you!" commented Dilys.</p>

<p>"You'll tell Poppie now, won't you?" urged Hetty.</p>

<p>Leonora shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Of course I shall. She can do what she likes. I
don't mind if she expels me! I'm sick of Briarcroft
and its strict rules. I'd rather try another school,
where they'd allow one to buy more sweets. I never
much wanted to come here. I think I'll go and explain
to Poppie now; she'll be in the study. If she
expels me, I could just go home in time for next
Thursday. Mother's giving a big garden party, and
having some Russian dancers down from London.
They're to give a performance on a platform on the
lawn. I'm simply wild to see them!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>As Leonora walked calmly from the room, the girls
broke into a universal "Well!" of astonished comment.</p>

<p>"She didn't even tell you she was sorry, Gipsy!" remarked
Lennie.</p>

<p>"Never mind! As long as she sets me right with
Poppie I don't care," returned Gipsy.</p>

<p>"She seems to want to be expelled," said Dilys.</p>

<p>"Poppie's pet won't be expelled, no fear!" laughed
Hetty. "Catch Poppie parting with her millionairess!
She's much too good an advertisement for the school."</p>

<p>"I think Poppie'll have somewhat to say on the
subject, though!" remarked Dilys.</p>

<p>Both Dilys and Hetty proved right. Leonora was
not expelled, but Miss Poppleton gave her a severe
lecture on the error of her ways, and a warning
against any further transgression of Briarcroft rules.
She returned to the Juniors' room in a very chastened
frame of mind.</p>

<p>"Poppie was as hard as nails," she volunteered.
"She won't let me go home on Thursday to the
garden party, so I shan't see the Russian dancers.
Isn't it a shame?"</p>

<p>"Well, in my opinion it about serves you right,
Leonora Parker," retorted Dilys. "You've looked at
the affair all along entirely from your own point of
view. I don't believe you'd have told now if you
hadn't wanted to go home. You've not begged Gipsy's
pardon yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind!" said Gipsy magnanimously.
"What do I care, now it's all serene with Poppie?
I've proved I don't tell fibs, anyhow. I like people
to know I'm straight and square and above-board,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
and since that's put right, I vote we drop the subject."</p>

<p>"I shall have the picnic next week, even if I don't
see the Russian dancers," murmured Leonora.</p>

<p>The suggestion of a united picnic for the whole of
the Lower School, which had been unanimously carried
at the Guild meeting, had been approved by Miss
Poppleton, and the date fixed for a day early in July.
As it was the first outing in connection with the
United Guild, the girls were anxious to celebrate the
occasion with as much observance as possible. It had
been decided to visit a castle about six miles away,
and it was thought that the ruins would provide a
picturesque setting for something in the nature of a
grand ceremony.</p>

<p>"Like the Freemasons, you know," said Gipsy, "or
any of those old 'worshipful companies' that meet and
have big dinners and enjoy themselves."</p>

<p>"What do the Freemasons do?" enquired Lennie.
"I thought their meetings were dead secrets."</p>

<p>"So they are; but sometimes they have processions
through the streets, and carry banners. We might
have a banner, and wear badges."</p>

<p>The idea of a banner appealed to the girls, who set
to work with the greatest enthusiasm to make one.
It was designed by Fiona Campbell, and carried out
by a committee of six, chosen for their skill in needlework.
It had a cream-coloured ground, on which
was a bold pattern, in appliqu&eacute;, of pink briar roses
with green leaves, meant as a delicate compliment to
Briarcroft. In the centre, in large green letters, was
the motto chosen by the Guild: "United we Stand".<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
It was decided at a special meeting that every member
must wear a briar rose for a badge, and as real wild
roses seemed too perishable to be of much use, an
extra committee undertook to construct a sufficient
quantity of artificial ones out of crinkled paper.
Officers were to wear pale pink sashes, tied over the
right shoulder and under the left arm, and a wreath
of pink roses round their hats. The form of ceremony
for the occasion was entrusted to Gipsy's fertile brain,
for nobody else felt equal to inventing it. These preparations
naturally absorbed all the energies of the
Lower School. Many willing hands set to work to
make paper flowers, copying a very pretty specimen
of a briar rose twisted by the drawing mistress out
of pink crinkled paper, with a most natural-looking
green leaf, and secured with fine wire.</p>

<p>Gipsy, who wished the affair to be a great day in
the annals of the Juniors, kept adding fresh items to
her ceremonial programme till she made a list that
filled her with satisfaction. There was nothing she
loved so dearly as inventing entertainments, and this
festival gave her just the opportunity for which she
longed. As organizing secretary she was allowed full
powers of administration, so she picked out her performers,
called rehearsals, and arranged every detail
with scrupulous care and attention.</p>

<p>The school picnic had generally been held on Saturdays,
but thinking the castle would be more free from
visitors on a Friday, Miss Poppleton had granted a
special half-holiday for the purpose. Most fortunately
the day turned out to be fine, and by two o'clock
seventy-four excited Juniors were waiting for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
arrival of the wagonettes that were to convey them
to the ruins. Each Form was accompanied by its own
mistress, and Miss Poppleton and Miss Edith completed
the party. Every girl wore her briar rose badge,
and the officers their sashes and wreaths. The banner
was carried rolled up, but ready to be unfurled when
the ceremonies should begin. Riggside Tower, the
old ruined keep that was the goal of their excursion,
had a romantic history of its own, and had been the
scene of many an exciting struggle in border warfare.
The guidebook related the legends of illustrious
prisoners, fierce hand-to-hand combats, doughty champions,
secret passages, underground dungeons, thrilling
escapes, and other episodes of the past that added
greatly to the attraction of the ancient building.</p>

<p>Some of the girls had been there before, but to
others it was a fresh spot, and all looked with interest
as the wagonettes turned a particular corner of the
road where the first glimpse of the castle could be
seen. It was a grey, turreted fortress, with half of
its west wall battered down by Cromwell's cannon,
and the rest in a crumbling state, chiefly held together
by the great masses of ivy that clung round the worn
stones. In former days it must have been grim and
bare enough, but kindly Nature had thrown her
mantle of greenery around it, and softened its rugged
outlines. Wallflowers and scarlet valerian and the
pretty trailing ivy-leaved toadflax were growing in
every nook and cranny where they could find roothold;
a thick grove of trees clothed the base of the
south front; and the courtyard was a strip of verdant
sward thickly covered with daisies. Gipsy took a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
survey of the old keep with the greatest complacency.
No place could possibly have provided a better background
for the pageant she had arranged. The courtyard
made a natural theatre, and the stones lying about
would provide seats for the audience. Happily there
were very few visitors that day, so they had the castle
almost to themselves, and could go through their programme
without interfering with the convenience of
other people. It was decided to begin the ceremonies
at once, so that they would be over in good time before
tea.</p>

<p>The banner, which had been rolled on two school
pointers, was unfurled and borne aloft by Lennie
Chapman and Meg Gordon, and very fine it looked
with its design of wild roses and its motto in the
centre. The members of the Guild, walking two and
two, fell into line, and, preceded by the banner bearers
and the chief officers, marched round the courtyard.</p>

<p>Barbara Kendrick had been constituted crier, and,
ringing a small handbell, shouted the opening
announcement in true mediaeval fashion:</p>

<p>"Oyez! Oyez! Oyez! Be it known to one and
all that this worshipful companie is the Briarcroft
United Juniors' Guild."</p>

<p>As the girls marched they chanted a ditty, the
words of which had been composed by Gipsy for the
event, though the music was out of one of the school
song books:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"We've met to-day to celebrate<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A very great occasion,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">We wish to show by this display</span><br />

<br />

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Good luck to our United Guild!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Long may it prosper well!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>Miss Poppleton, Miss Edith, and the mistresses, who
composed the audience, applauded heartily at the end
of the marching song.</p>

<p>It had made a good introduction for the Guild, and
an opening for the proceedings which were to follow.
Gipsy's programme had been drawn up somewhat on
the lines of a May Day masque; she herself called it
"The Festival of the Briar Rose". It consisted of
a number of songs and dances, appropriate to the
occasion, which she had collected from the repertoire
of the Lower School. Each Form took its own turn.
The little girls of the First performed a charming
flower dance, the Second sang a madrigal in praise
of summer and the Lower Third a May Day glee, the
Upper Third executed a lively Tarantella, the Lower
Fourth took Sir Roger de Coverley, the Upper Fourth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
chanted an Elizabethan Ode to the Spring, while at
the end the whole Guild joined in a morris dance.</p>

<p>Besides wearing their badges, the girls had brought
with them some garlands and a number of bunches of
flowers, to be used in the dances, so that the whole
affair, seen against the background of the ancient
tower, had a most romantic and picturesque effect.
A few parties of visitors, who were looking over the
castle, stopped to watch the performance, and appeared
greatly to enjoy it. To Miss Poppleton and the
teachers the various items were of course well known,
as they had been often rendered at school; but thus
combined, in such suitable surroundings, they made
quite a pretty pageant. Gipsy was in her element,
marshalling, conducting, directing, and acting leader,
while all the time taking her own part in the singing
and dancing. As the members ranged themselves at
the end, and wound up the programme with "God
Save the King", she felt a thrill of delighted gratification.
The Guild, which had begun under her auspices,
and which she had so carefully fostered, seemed a
well-established institution of the Lower School,
likely to continue and flourish among the Juniors
for many years to come. If she had done nothing
else during her three terms at Briarcroft, it was a satisfaction
to feel that she had accomplished this much.
Perhaps some such thought struck her companions.</p>

<p>"Hip, hip, hip, hooray for the Guild!" shouted
Hetty Hancock. "And hip, hip, hip, hooray for the
Festival! And hip, hip, hip, hooray, girls, for our
secretary, Gipsy Latimer! She arranged it all, and
she deserves a hearty vote of thanks."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>As the vigorous cheers rang out, Gipsy stood with
flushed cheeks and shining eyes. It was sweet to
have her schoolgirl triumph, and to feel that her
efforts on behalf of her fellow Juniors had met with
so much appreciation.</p>

<p>When the applause died away and the girls broke
up, a stranger, who from behind a portion of the ruins
had been an eager witness of the proceedings, stepped
up to Miss Poppleton.</p>

<p>"I should like to add my congratulations," he remarked.
"Perhaps you don't remember me? If I may
have one word with the little secretary of your Guild,
she will tell you who I am."</p>

<p>But at that moment Gipsy caught sight of him, and
with one wild cry of "Father!" flung herself into his
arms.</p>

<p>How Mr. Latimer had arrived upon the scene at
such an extremely opportune moment demands a word
of explanation, so we will narrate his story as he told
it to Gipsy afterwards. In the previous November,
after landing at Cape Town, he had joined a pioneering
expedition, and gone far into the interior to prospect
for minerals. The little party had experienced
many hardships, perils, and privations, but had been
very successful in its discoveries, finding a rich vein of
gold that promised a handsome return when worked.
Once back at Cape Town, Mr. Latimer had taken the
first vessel to England, landing there with the mails.
Finding that he could reach Briarcroft as soon as a
letter, he had decided to go straight there in person,
instead of writing to Gipsy to tell her of his coming.
On his arrival at the school, he had learnt that his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
daughter, with a number of her companions, had
started for a picnic at Riggside Tower; so, keeping
the taxicab in which he had driven from Greyfield
station, he had followed at once to the castle. Finding
the Guild celebrations in progress, he had not
interrupted the programme, but, concealing himself
in an angle where he could see without being seen, he
had remained an interested spectator of the pageant,
waiting till the affair was over before he made his
presence known.</p>

<p>Gipsy's rapture at this reunion was enough to compensate
her for all the trouble she had endured during
her father's absence. "You won't go away, Dad, and
leave me again?" she pleaded.</p>

<p>"No, sweetheart! Fortunately I have business in
connection with these newly discovered mines that will
keep me in England for a year or two. You can continue
at Briarcroft, where by all appearance you seem
to be much appreciated, and we can spend all your
holidays together. No more gadding about the world
just at present. Will that suit you, little woman?"</p>

<p>"Splendiferously!" answered Gipsy, with a sigh of
ecstasy.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>There is very little more to be told. For Gipsy the
sequel was a time of intense thankfulness and utter
content. Two matters, however, which disturbed her,
she brought to her father's notice, and he at once
settled them to their common satisfaction.</p>

<p>He paid a visit to the secondhand shop of Mr.
Daniel Lucas in Greyfield, and bought back her watch
and chain; and though he was obliged to pay four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
pounds to regain what she had parted with for ten
shillings, he was glad to get possession on any terms
of what was to him a treasure to be valued for old
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'sake's'">time's</ins> sake. He further hunted out the little confectioner
at Waterloo who had sheltered his daughter
in her hour of need, and gave her not only his heartfelt
thanks, but a more substantial token of his appreciation.
Gipsy, you may be sure, lost no time in
introducing him to her friends the Gordons, for whose
share in fetching her back from Liverpool Mr. Latimer
considered he owed a debt of gratitude. It was arranged
that the two families should spend a summer
holiday together in Switzerland&mdash;an event to which
Donald, Meg, and Gipsy, with their thoughts on the
joys of mountaineering, looked forward with the
keenest anticipation.</p>

<p>"I've only one regret," confessed Gipsy on the
breaking-up day. "If I'm moved up next term into
the Fifth, I shan't be Lower School any more, and
it will mean goodbye to the United Guild."</p>

<p>But as none of us can remain stationary, and all
growings are outgrowings, I think we may safely
predict that Gipsy, who won her way as leader of the
Juniors, will have an equally successful career among
the Seniors, and that her name will be handed down
in the annals of Briarcroft institutions as that of one
who upheld the common weal, and whose record was
an asset to the school.</p>
